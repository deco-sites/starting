Imagine unlocking the low latencies of the edge, eliminating the dependency on third-party APIs – welcome to the era of Async Rendering.\n\n## Understanding the Current React Rendering Process:\n\nIn the realm of React applications, the conventional approach to Server Side Rendering (SSR) is the [fetch-then-render](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fetch-then-render-render-as-you-fetch-fetch-on-render-amit-pal/) model, where rendering is split between two steps, one for data fetching and the other for generating html. To illustrate, let's envision a typical scenario on an e-commerce website's home page. This page comprises two shelves, each displaying a collection of products. To populate these shelves, the application needs to make two requests to the e-commerce API.\n\nNow, here's where the challenge arises: React, following the fetch-then-render paradigm, insists that both requests must be completed before any server-side rendering (SSR) can take place. Picture this – a user lands on the home page, eager to explore the latest products, and two API requests are initiated by the edge server. If, for any reason, one of these requests hangs or encounters a delay, the entire SSR process comes to a standstill, leaving the user in a frustrating waiting game.\n\nThis latency bottleneck becomes particularly evident in data-rich applications, hindering the user experience and potentially leading to abandonment. It's a scenario where the slowest API response time dictates the overall rendering speed, introducing unnecessary delays that impact user satisfaction.\n\nFor the nerds in the audience, we can derive a simple equation that may give us the expected waiting time for the fetch-then-render model. Say that for rendering a page, we perform `n` requests in parallel, and each request has a probability `p` of being considered a \"fast\" request. Then, for the page to be \"fast\", all requests need to be \"fast\", thus the probability of the page being \"fast\" is:\n\n```\np_fast = p^n\n```\n\n99% of requests usually responds within 500ms, and slow requests take around 3 seconds. Let's call these quantities l_fast and l_slow respectively. Thus, the expected latency for a web page in the fetch-then-render model is:\n\n```\nl_page = l_fast * p_fast + l_slow * (1-p_fast)\n```\n\nDue to issues with commerce APIs, we have some customers that, for rendering a page, perform 97 requests. Plugin-in  these numbers into the equation we have an expected page latency is around 2 seconds, even tough 99% of the time the requests respond in less than 500ms! This means that even if we improve the APIs, the mathematical model behind this approach prohibits us from being fast. Note that this model can also be used for caching. If our cache hit rate is 99% (which is around 30% in practice), the expected latency is dominated by the slow APIs. Math is cruel my friend, but there's a hope! \n\n## Progressive Loading: A Smarter Approach:\n\nEnter Progressive Loading – a technique that is imune to slow requests. Rather than waiting for all content to be ready on the server before responding to the client, Progressive Loading renders content from fast requests, defaulting to leaving skeletons and loading states on slow requests contents, offering users an immediate visual experience.\n\n<img width=\"1062\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-02-16 at 13 56 35\" src=\"https://github.com/deco-cx/community/assets/1753396/cf4728c7-82c6-4628-b8cf-b7c6cc213bb4\">\n\nThis approach decreases user anxiety by displaying visual feedback the system is working into the desired state. Highly dynamic systems like Youtube and Instagram implement this kind of skeleton based approach, so internet users are used to this kind of interaction. However, manually implementing Progressive Loading in your website can be challenging and cumbersome.\n\n## Introducing Async Rendering: \nThe Game-Changing Feature:\n\nHere comes Async Rendering, our latest feature designed to simplify the Progressive Loading paradigm. The magic lies in tight coupling Progressive loading into our framework. Here's how it works:\n\nLoaders are now tied to a time budget. Once this threshold is reached, loaders that have finished their work will have their content rendered to the final html as usual. Loaders consuming slow APIs will raise an exception and a loading state will be rendered in sections consuming this loader. This loading state will use our [Partials]() feature to hydrate and replace the missing section lazily.  \n\nThis means that there's no need to manually add the `Deferred` section anymore. Any section is now deferred depending on the API they are consuming.\n\n## Customizing Loading States Made Easy:\n\nTo make your website truly yours, we've simplified the customization of loading states. Just export a `LoadingFallback` component from your section and this will be used as your loading state. A standard blank loading state will be used if no `LoadingFallback` component is exported. \n\nFor instance, let's get this Section\n\n```tsx\nexport default function Section(props: Props) { ... }\n```\n\nTo add a custom loading state:\n\n```tsx\nexport default function Section(props: Props) { ... }\n\nexport function LoadingFallback () {\n  return <div>loading...</div>\n}\n```\n\n> Tip: try exporting a component named ErrorFallback to handle any possible error this section may encounter\n\nto learn more, check out or [docs](https://deco.cx/docs/en/developing/loading-fallback)\n\n## Seo\n\nAs you may know, partially rendering a page's content is not ideal to SEO. For this reason, whenever our system detects it's google or any other search engine bot requesting your page, out system will fallback to fetch-then-render approach, delivering the best SEO possible.  \n\n## Taking a Tour of Async Rendering in Deco.cx's Admin:\n\nReady to experience the power of Async Rendering firsthand? Join us for a guided tour on activating this feature within Deco.cx's admin interface. Discover how easy it is to enhance your website's performance with a few simple steps.\n\n1. Make sure your project is up-to-date to the latest deco and apps versions by running:\n\n```sh\ndeno run -A https://deco.cx/update\n```\n\n2. Open your site's app on deco.cx admin and look for Async Rendering option. Set it to 0 to disable or any other value to enable it. \n<img width=\"377\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-02-16 at 13 39 19\" src=\"https://github.com/deco-cx/community/assets/1753396/3852fdf9-2055-4f27-962b-2e192eb4bcf3\">\n\nThat's it! now your sections are async rendering! \n\n## Impacts on Core Web Vitals\n\nAsync rendering makes your website more responsive, reducing user anxiety and improving the overall experience. However, it may affect your Web Vitals indicators. Let's analyze how async rendering influences your final score.\n\n### FCP (First Contentful Paint)\n\nFCP is significantly improved because the page doesn't need to wait for slow third-party APIs for responses.\n\n### LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)\n\nLCP may either improve or worsen depending on the source of your LCP element. If images come from APIs, it could lower the score. However, if images are uploaded via Deco's admin, it will notably increase. For example, on home pages where the banner is uploaded using Deco's CMS, the LCP will be much better. However, on product pages, the LCP score might decrease since we need to wait for a few round trips before downloading the product image.\n\n### CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)\n\nCLS should remain unchanged. Well-designed `LoadingFallback` components shouldn't contribute to any layout shifts. If you observe any changes in CLS, consult your developer to enhance `LoadingFallback` components.\n\n### FID (First Input Delay)\n\nFID might slightly increase since the page isn't rendered all at once, thereby better utilizing CPU time.\n\nOverall, you should notice an improvement in Web Vitals indicators.\n\nCurious to see Async Rendering in action? Head over to our [storefront template](https://storefront-vtex.deco.site/) and witness the transformative impact on website performance."},"pt":{"descr":"Novo modo de renderizaçāo para tempo de respostas instantâneos","title":"Renderizaçāo Assíncrona na borda","content":"## Introdução:\n\nHoje, estamos entusiasmados em apresentar um recurso inovador que irá redefinir o desempenho do seu site. Imagine desbloquear as baixas latências da borda, eliminando a dependência de APIs de terceiros - bem-vindo à era do Renderização Assíncrona. \n\n## Compreendendo o Processo de Renderização Atual do React:\n\nNo mundo das aplicações React, a abordagem convencional para a Renderização do Lado do Servidor (SSR, na sigla em inglês) é o modelo [fetch-then-render](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fetch-then-render-render-as-you-fetch-fetch-on-render-amit-pal/), onde a renderização é dividida em dois passos, um para busca de dados e outro para geração de html. Para ilustrar, vamos imaginar um cenário típico na página inicial de um site de comércio eletrônico. Esta página é composta por duas prateleiras, cada uma exibindo uma coleção de produtos. Para preencher essas prateleiras, a aplicação precisa fazer duas requisições à API de comércio eletrônico.\n\nAqui está onde surge o desafio: o React, seguindo o paradigma fetch-then-render, insiste que ambas as requisições devem ser concluídas antes que qualquer renderização do lado do servidor (SSR) possa ocorrer. Imagine isso - um usuário chega à página inicial, ansioso para explorar os últimos produtos, e duas requisições à API são iniciadas pelo servidor de borda. Se, por qualquer motivo, uma dessas requisições ficar pendente ou encontrar um atraso, todo o processo de SSR fica paralisado, deixando o usuário em um jogo frustrante de espera.\n\nEsse gargalo de latência se torna particularmente evidente em aplicações ricas em dados, prejudicando a experiência do usuário e potencialmente levando ao abandono. É um cenário onde o tempo de resposta mais lento da API dita a velocidade geral de renderização, introduzindo atrasos desnecessários que impactam a satisfação do usuário.\n\nPara os nerds na plateia, podemos derivar uma equação simples que pode nos dar o tempo de espera esperado para o modelo fetch-then-render. Digamos que, para renderizar uma página, realizamos `n` requisições em paralelo, e cada requisição tem uma probabilidade `p` de ser considerada uma requisição \"rápida\". Então, para que a página seja \"rápida\", todas as requisições precisam ser \"rápidas\", assim a probabilidade da página ser \"rápida\" é:\n\n```\np_rápido = p^n\n```\n\n99% das requisições geralmente respondem em menos de 500ms, e as requisições lentas levam cerca de 3 segundos. Vamos chamar essas quantidades de l_rápido e l_lento, respectivamente. Assim, a latência esperada para uma página da web no modelo fetch-then-render é:\n\n```\nl_página = l_rápido * p_rápido + l_lento * (1-p_rápido)\n```\n\nDevido a problemas com APIs de comércio, temos alguns clientes que, para renderizar uma página, realizam 97 requisições. Ao inserir esses números na equação, temos uma latência esperada da página de cerca de 2 segundos, mesmo que 99% do tempo as requisições respondam em menos de 500ms! Isso significa que mesmo se melhorarmos as APIs, o modelo matemático por trás dessa abordagem nos impede de sermos rápidos. Note que este modelo também pode ser usado para caching. Se nossa taxa de acerto no cache for de 99% (o que é cerca de 30% na prática), a latência esperada é dominada pelas APIs lentas. A matemática é cruel, meu amigo, mas há esperança!\n\n## Carregamento Progressivo: Uma Abordagem Mais Inteligente:\n\nIntroduza o Carregamento Progressivo - uma técnica que é imune a requisições lentas. Em vez de esperar que todo o conteúdo esteja pronto no servidor antes de responder ao cliente, o Carregamento Progressivo renderiza o conteúdo das requisições rápidas, recorrendo a esqueletos e estados de carregamento para o conteúdo de requisições lentas, oferecendo aos usuários uma experiência visual imediata.\n\n<img width=\"1062\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-02-16 at 13 56 35\" src=\"https://github.com/deco-cx/community/assets/1753396/cf4728c7-82c6-4628-b8cf-b7c6cc213bb4\">\n\nEsta abordagem diminui a ansiedade do usuário, mostrando feedback visual de que o sistema está trabalhando para o estado desejado. Sistemas altamente dinâmicos como YouTube e Instagram implementam esse tipo de abordagem baseada em esqueletos, então os usuários da internet estão acostumados a esse tipo de interação. No entanto, implementar manualmente o Carregamento Progressivo em seu site pode ser desafiador e trabalhoso.\n\n## Apresentando a Renderização Assíncrona: O Recurso que Muda o Jogo:\n\nAqui vem a Renderização Assíncrona, nosso recurso mais recente projetado para simplificar o paradigma de Carregamento Progressivo. A magia está na integração estreita do carregamento progressivo em nosso framework. Veja como funciona:\n\nOs carregadores agora estão vinculados a um orçamento de tempo. Uma vez atingido esse limite, os carregadores que concluíram seu trabalho terão seu conteúdo renderizado no html final como de costume. Os carregadores que consomem APIs lentas levantarão uma exceção e um estado de carregamento será renderizado nas seções que consomem este carregador. Este estado de carregamento usará nosso recurso [Partials]() para hidratar e substituir a seção ausente preguiçosamente.\n\nIsso significa que não há necessidade de adicionar manualmente a seção `Deferred` mais. Qualquer seção agora é adiada dependendo da API que estão consumindo.\n\n## Personalização dos Estados de Carregamento Facilitada:\n\nPara tornar seu site verdadeiramente seu, simplificamos a personalização dos estados de carregamento. Basta exportar um componente `LoadingFallback` da sua seção e este será usado como seu estado de carregamento. Um estado de carregamento em branco padrão será usado se nenhum componente `LoadingFallback` for exportado.\n\nPor exemplo, vamos pegar esta Seção\n\n```tsx\nexport default function Section(props: Props) { ... }\n```\n\nPara adicionar um estado de carregamento personalizado:\n\n```tsx\nexport default function Section(props: Props) { ... }\n\nexport function LoadingFallback () {\n  return <div>carregando...</div>\n}\n```\n\n> Dica: tente exportar um componente chamado ErrorFallback para lidar com qualquer possível erro que esta seção possa encontrar\n\nPara saber mais, confira nossos [docs](https://deco.cx/docs/en/developing/loading-fallback)\n\n## SEO\n\nComo você deve saber, renderizar parcialmente o conteúdo de uma página não é ideal para SEO. Por esse motivo, sempre que nosso sistema detectar que é o Google ou qualquer outro mecanismo de busca solicitando sua página, nosso sistema recorrerá à abordagem fetch-then-render, oferecendo o melhor SEO possível.\n\n## Faça um Tour pela Renderização Assíncrona no Admin da Deco.cx:\n\nPronto para experimentar o poder da Renderização Assíncrona em primeira mão? Junte-se a nós para um tour guiado sobre como ativar este recurso dentro da interface de administração da Deco.cx. Descubra como é fácil melhorar o desempenho do seu site com alguns passos simples.\n\n1. Certifique-se de que seu projeto esteja atualizado para as últimas versões do deco e dos aplicativos executando:\n\n```sh\ndeno run -A https://deco.cx/update\n```\n\n2. Abra o aplicativo do seu site no admin da deco.cx e procure pela opção de Renderização Assíncrona. Defina-o como 0 para desativar ou qualquer outro valor para ativá-lo.\n\n<img width=\"377\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-02-16 at 13 39 19\" src=\"https://github.com/deco-cx/community/assets/1753396/3852fdf9-2055-4f27-962b-2e192eb4bcf3\">\n\nÉ isso! agora suas seções estão sendo renderizadas de forma assíncrona!\n\n## Impactos nos Principais Indicadores da Web\n\nA renderização assíncrona torna o seu site mais responsivo, reduzindo a ansiedade dos usuários e melhorando a experiência geral. No entanto, pode afetar os indicadores principais da Web. Vamos analisar como a renderização assíncrona influencia sua pontuação final.\n\n### FCP (First Contentful Paint)\n\nO FCP é significativamente melhorado porque a página não precisa esperar por respostas de APIs de terceiros lentas.\n\n### LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)\n\nO LCP pode melhorar ou piorar dependendo da origem do seu elemento LCP. Se as imagens vêm de APIs, isso pode diminuir a pontuação. No entanto, se as imagens forem carregadas via administração da Deco, isso aumentará consideravelmente. Por exemplo, em páginas iniciais onde o banner é carregado usando o CMS da Deco, o LCP será muito melhor. No entanto, em páginas de produtos, a pontuação do LCP pode diminuir, já que precisamos esperar por algumas viagens antes de baixar a imagem do produto.\n\n### CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)\n\nO CLS deve permanecer inalterado. Componentes `LoadingFallback` bem projetados não devem contribuir para nenhum deslocamento de layout.

Fast, responsive design**\n\nGoogle increasingly prioritizes mobile versions of websites. Your site must be responsive, ensuring content loads quickly across all devices.\n\n<div style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.10); border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5em\">\n💨 Every site built on <a href=\"http://deco.cx\" target=\"_blank\">deco.cx</a> is inherently responsive.

Customizable URLs**\n\nHaving the flexibility to incorporate keywords into your URLs is an effective optimization strategy.\n\n<div style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.10); border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5em\">🔗 By exposing both backend and frontend code to site creators, <a href=\"http://deco.cx\" target=\"_blank\">deco.cx</a> allows for full control over the URL structure, enabling optimal SEO customization.\n</div>\n\nFor instance, Gear SEO's project [BolsasJá](http://bolsasja.com.br) achieved significant SEO improvements by customizing category and subcategory URLs to the first level of navigation, enhancing page relevance.\n\nCategory: [https://bolsasja.com.br/bolsas-femininas](https://bolsasja.com.br/bolsas-femininas)\n\nSubcategory: [https://bolsasja.com.br/bolsa-casual](https://bolsasja.com.br/bolsa-casual)\n\n### **3. Integrated content strategy**\n\nMerging ecommerce with content-rich pages is a tactic to both improve the Customer Experience and increase SEO results. This content ranges from embedded ecommerce blogs or customized landing page for products and categories. \n\n<div style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.10); border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5em\"> 🧩 On <a href=\"http://deco.cx\" target=\"_blank\">deco.cx</a>, you can seamlessly blend text, images, videos, and other HTML elements into Product Detail Pages (PDPs), as well as manage satellite content within your domain, leveraging built-in blogging and frontend/backend customization for superior SEO results.\n</div>\n\n\n![Aviator.png](https://ozksgdmyrqcxcwhnbepg.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/assets/530/0e76a4b4-7e7d-4f73-9dde-8ddd0cca74b0)\n\n_Aviator's [PDP](https://www.aviator.com.br/camisa-oxford-slim-fit-verde-oliva-camisa-oxford-slim-fit-verde-oliva-vde-oliva/p), and [blog](https://www.aviator.com.br/blog)_\n\n### **4. Flexible collections and landing pages**\n\nCustom collections and landing pages are key for targeting long-tail keywords and seasonal traffic.\n\n<div style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.10); border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5em\"> 🛍️ <a href=\"http://deco.cx\" target=\"_blank\">deco.cx</a>, enables the creation of product collections and landing pages on custom URLs not directly linked to the main catalog tree, facilitating creation of content that is more likely to convert buyers.\n</div>\n\n\n![Embelleze.png](https://ozksgdmyrqcxcwhnbepg.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/assets/530/a4f84f0c-a594-41af-834c-80fc23734289)\n\n_Embelleze's [special Black Friday LP](https://www.embelleze.com/black-friday), with products outside of main catalogue_\n\n### **5. Editable meta elements**\n\nHaving control over and easy access to edit meta tags / titles is key to getting the most out of Google and Bing indexing, since this information is what new users will first see when they discover a website. One of the most relevant meta tags is the canonical tag, which tells the search engine which one is the canonical URL. The canonical URL is the version of a webpage chosen by the search engine as the main version when there are duplicates. This selected URL is prioritized to avoid showing repetitive content that does not provide unique value in search results.\n\n<div style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.10); border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5em\"> 🎯 [deco.cx](http://deco.cx) allows for full control over meta elements throughout your site (title, description, meta image, and more). When it comes to canonical tags, deco.cx not only assigns canonicals by default to make sure search engines know how to prioritize the most relevant URLs, it also makes these tags totally customizable. This flexibility means that you can avoid secondary URLs created through pagination or filters from being indexed by search engines.\n</div>\n\n\nFor example, on deco.cx, only option A is indexed by default (although this is 100% editable):\n\nA. yoursite.com/categories/category-1\n\nB. yoursite.com/categories/category-1/?ordenation=true&page=3\n\n![Form created on deco.cx by Zee.Dog to edit SEO meta elements](https://ozksgdmyrqcxcwhnbepg.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/assets/530/d4fc86df-6d1a-4fa5-b8ee-0d3435a40b4d)\n\n_Form created on deco.cx by [Zee.Dog](http://Zee.Dog) to edit SEO meta elements_\n\n### **7. SEO-friendly frameworks**\n\nSites built with frameworks that ensure search engines can accurately crawl and index pages are generally ranked higher. \n\n<div style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.10); border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5em\"> ⚙️ <a href=\"http://deco.cx\" target=\"_blank\">deco.cx</a>'s framework is 100% server side by default, meaning that no JavaScript is sent to the client browser. Even if you add client side scripts, they are first rendered on the server side. This guarantees that search engines have access to all the content in your site.\n</div>\n\n### **8. Product organization and availability**\n\nWhenever a product is out-of-stock or removed, all organic visits to the corresponding URL result in errors (page not found, error 404). Correctly managing these situations to redirect your visitors is important to maintain traffic and search rankings. \n\n<div style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.10); border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5em\">🚫 Many platforms allow you to redirect missing URLs to similar addresses or to your site's homepage. On <a href=\"http://deco.cx\" target=\"_blank\">deco.cx</a>, you can go a step further, keeping the original URL available and directing your visitor to similar products in your store. This practice prevents errors in searches for missing products and enables out-of-stock items to keep on bringing organic traffic into your site.\n</div>\n\n### **9. Constant site availability**\n\nA high uptime is crucial for maintaining SEO rankings.\n\n<div style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.10); border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5em\">✅ Sites on <a href=\"http://deco.cx\" target=\"_blank\">deco.cx</a> are guaranteed 99.99% uptime on average, ensuring that they are always available to both customers and search engines.</div>\n\n### **deco.cx: a leader in SEO-focused ecommerce**\n\nGear SEO's analysis positions deco.cx as a leader in implementing SEO recommendations with minimal complexity.

Elementos meta editáveis**\n\nTer controle e fácil acesso para editar meta tags/títulos é fundamental para obter o máximo proveito da indexação do Google e do Bing, pois essas informações são o que os novos usuários verão primeiro ao descobrir um website. Uma das meta tags mais relevantes é a tag canônica, que informa ao mecanismo de busca qual é a URL canônica. A URL canônica é a versão de uma página da web escolhida pelo mecanismo de busca como a versão principal quando há duplicatas. Esta URL selecionada é priorizada para evitar a exibição de conteúdo repetitivo que não fornece valor único nos resultados da pesquisa.\n\n<div style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.10); border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5em\"> 🎯 A [deco.cx](http://deco.cx) permite controle total sobre elementos meta em todo o seu site (título, descrição, imagem meta e mais). Quando se trata de tags canônicas, a deco.cx não apenas atribui canônicos por padrão para garantir que os mecanismos de busca saibam como priorizar as URLs mais relevantes, mas também torna essas tags totalmente personalizáveis. Essa flexibilidade significa que você pode evitar que URLs secundárias criadas por paginação ou filtros sejam indexadas pelos mecanismos de busca.\n</div>\n\n\nPor exemplo, na deco.cx só a opção A é indexada por padrão (embora isso seja 100% editável):\n\nA. yoursite.com/categories/category-1\n\nB. yoursite.com/categories/category-1/?ordenation=true&page=3\n\n![Formulário criado na deco.cx pela Zee.Dog para editar elementos meta de SEO](https://ozksgdmyrqcxcwhnbepg.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/assets/530/d4fc86df-6d1a-4fa5-b8ee-0d3435a40b4d)\n\n_Formulário criado na deco.cx pela [Zee.Dog](http://Zee.Dog) para editar elementos meta de SEO_\n\n### **7. Frameworks SEO-friendly**\n\nSites construídos com frameworks que garantem que os mecanismos de busca possam rastrear e indexar páginas geralmente são classificados em posições mais altas. \n\n<div style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.10); border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5em\"> ⚙️ O framework da <a href=\"http://deco.cx\" target=\"_blank\">deco.cx</a> é 100% server side por padrão, o que significa que nenhum JavaScript é enviado para o navegador do cliente. Mesmo que você adicione scripts do lado do cliente, eles são primeiro renderizados no lado do servidor. Isso garante que os mecanismos de busca tenham acesso a todo o conteúdo do seu site.\n</div>\n\n### **8. Organização e disponibilidade de produtos**\n\nSempre que um produto estiver fora de estoque ou removido, todas as visitas orgânicas à URL correspondente resultarão em erros (página não encontrada, erro 404). Gerenciar corretamente essas situações para redirecionar seus visitantes é importante para manter o tráfego e as classificações de busca. \n\n<div style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.10); border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5em\">🚫 Muitas plataformas permitem que você redirecione URLs ausentes para endereços semelhantes ou para a página inicial do seu site. Na <a href=\"http://deco.cx\" target=\"_blank\">deco.cx</a>, você pode ir um passo além, mantendo a URL original disponível e direcionando seu visitante para produtos similares em sua loja. Essa prática evita erros em buscas por produtos indisponíveis e permite que itens fora de estoque continuem trazendo tráfego orgânico para seu site.\n</div>\n\n### **9. Disponibilidade constante do site**\n\nUm alto tempo de atividade é crucial para manter as classificações de SEO.\n\n<div style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.10); border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5em\">✅ Os sites na <a href=\"http://deco.cx\" target=\"_blank\">deco.cx</a> têm garantia de 99,99% de tempo de atividade em média, assegurando que estejam sempre disponíveis tanto para clientes quanto para mecanismos de busca.\n</div>\n\n### **deco.cx: líder em e-commerce focado em SEO**\n\nA análise da Gear SEO posiciona a deco.cx como líder na implementação de recomendações de SEO com mínima complexidade.

Among the platforms we have worked with, we can affirm that all of them have their pros and cons.\n\nThere are platforms that meet the basic technical recommendations of SEO and platforms that meet almost all the technical recommendations we have worked with.\n\nGiven this scenario, we have compiled a list of the main technical recommendations that we consider an e-commerce platform should contain in terms of SEO support. This survey is based on our experience working with the main e-commerce platforms over the years.\n\nThis will be important because it can guide the choice of the platform according to the points it covers or the points that should be considered in the development of a proprietary platform. In this universe we consider both commercial e-commerce platforms and open-source e-commerce platforms.\n\nWe also have our demonstrative e-commerce where we apply all the fundamentals of SEO through our \"SEO in Practice\" program. Bolsas Já is a headless e-commerce using the Deco platform with a Shopify backend.\n\n## **What Points Should Be Considered?**\n\nBelow is a list with the points that we consider important for an e-commerce to yield more effective SEO results, taking into account a project where all pages are worked on.\n\n### **1 - Mobile Support**\n\nThis point is one of the most important, if not the most. It is essential that the platform considers a responsive site with satisfactory loading time.\n\nWhen we talk about a responsive site, it means that it should be the same site for desktop and mobile, including the same URL. Google is already committed to completely changing the way sites are crawled, prioritizing the mobile versions of all of them.\n\nIn this dynamic, specific sites for mobile ([m.site.com.br](http://m.site.com.br/)) will cease to exist, making room for responsive sites. In fact, Google already has documentation and recommendations for this change.\n\nBolsas Já is an example of a 100% responsive mobile application, meeting all technical SEO requirements.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://gearseo.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bolsasja-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Mobile Support\"/>\n</p>\n\n### **2 - URL Support**\n\nAs unimportant as it may seem, a platform that offers support to customize URLs as much as possible is always better when it comes to SEO.\n\nA clear example is a platform where category pages must necessarily contain, at the second level, the classification /collection/, and products must necessarily contain, at the second level, the classification /products/.\n\nNo matter how small the detail, we will be at a disadvantage in the competition when the platform offers more flexible URL customization, considering that the use of the keyword in the URL is a good optimization practice recommended by Google.\n\nIn the Bolsa Já site, we customized 100% of the Category and Subcategory URLs so that they all remained at the first level of URL navigation. With this, we increased the relevance of the pages in relation to the home page.\n\nCategory: [https://bolsasja.com.br/bolsas-femininas](https://bolsasja.com.br/bolsas-femininas)\n\nSubcategory:\n[https://bolsasja.com.br/bolsa-casual](https://bolsasja.com.br/bolsa-casual)\n\n### **3 - Content Structure**\n\nSuccessful SEO projects increasingly bring e-commerce closer to content. See some examples below:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://gearseo.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/estrutura-conteudos-submarino.jpg\" alt=\"Mobile Support\"/>\n</p>\n\nNotice that on the category page of the site, there is significant space for content insertion. \n\nToday having an e-commerce on one side and a blog created and used on a subdomain [blog.site.com.br](http://blog.site.com.br/) is no longer a guarantee of successful SEO work. Therefore, if the e-commerce platform offers this type of support for content creation, it will be a differentiator in terms of SEO.\n\nThe Bolsas Já site is an example where we can apply content, images, and HTML elements in categories and subcategories, while working with the products at the same time.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://gearseo.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/estrutura-conteudos-bolsasja-600x446.jpg\" alt=\"Mobile Support\"/>\n</p>\n\n### **4 - HTML Content Application Support**\n\nFollowing the above example, if the platform offers support for creating a content structure in e-commerce in HTML, it will be possible to insert images, internal links, and other HTML attributes that will be favorable for an SEO project.\n\n### **5 – Blog Creation in Directory**\n\nThere are platforms that allow the creation of content components or a blog directly at the second level of the URL.\n\nExample: [yoursite.com.br/blog](http://yoursite.com.br/blog)\n\nThis option allows you to work with content directly on the URL, avoiding the creation of a subdomain outside of the site. As mentioned above, the closer the content is to the domain, the better the chances of results.\n\nThe example of Bolsa Já uses the [Fashion Tips](https://bolsasja.com.br/dicas-de-moda/) subdirectory to display content related to the segment within without the need to create a subdomain.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://gearseo.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/blog-em-subdiretorio-600x377.jpg\" alt=\"Mobile Support\"/>\n</p>\n\n### **6 – Collection Creation**\n\nLook at this URL: https://www.dafiti.com.br/rasteiras-com-pedras/.\n\nBasically, a collection of products was created in a personalized URL that is not directly linked to the catalog and the product menu. This is only possible because the platform allows new product collections to be created without needing to be associated with the navigation menu or the category tree.\n\nWith this, it will be possible to create content and collections that are not directly associated with the menu (for example, \"Carnival clothes\", \"dog outfits\", etc.) and enhance work with long-tail keywords highly prone to conversion.\n\nIn addition, it will also be possible to create a menu or an exclusive section for this type of page. The example in the image below ([cea.com.br](http://cea.com.br/)) is the creation of a glossary only with terms that are not contained in the menu but are considered relevant in terms of organic search traffic.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://ozksgdmyrqcxcwhnbepg.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/assets/530/f434958b-bff9-41dc-aaff-2025073669e0\" alt=\"Mobile Support\"/>\n</p>\n\n### **7 – Custom Landing Pages Creation**\n\nThe URL https://www.kabum.com.br/hotsite/blackfriday/ is an example where it is possible to create a 100% customized Landing Page without direct association for viewing products.\n\nGenerally, this strategy is used for creating seasonal pages for specific content. Precisely on the date of the occasion (Christmas, Black Friday, Mother's Day, etc.), this page is redirected to a product showcase URL, leveraging the organic traffic developed throughout the year.\n\nIn the Bolsas Já website, it is possible to create both collections and customized Landing Pages:\n\nhttps://bolsasja.com.br/bolsa-caramelo/: These are collections created based on keywords and search volume, and, as explained above, there is no direct relationship with the navigation tree.\n\nhttps://bolsasja.com.br/bolsas-dia-das-maes: A Landing Page created exclusively to meet a seasonal demand with keywords and search volume for an SEO project.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://gearseo.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/paginas-customizadas-colecoes-600x297.jpg\" alt=\"Mobile Support\"/>\n</p>\n\n### **8 – WEBp Support**\n\nAccording to Google (https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/faq), images in Webp format have a size reduction of up to 30% compared to traditional image formats (PNG, JPG, GIF). The Webp format itself already makes the site faster and, consequently, more advantageous in terms of SEO. A platform that supports this format is highly recommended.\n\n### **9 – Free Editing for Meta Description, Title Tags, and Headers**\n\nEven today, there are platforms where the titles and meta descriptions of pages are created automatically, not allowing customization. This mainly occurs with product pages, specifically with the h1 headers.\n\nAs a result, we lose control of all the titles and meta descriptions that exceed the character limit for display in search engines. Consider manually customizing the 20% most important products in your e-commerce if you have many products.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://gearseo.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/titulos-metadescricoes-seo-ecommerce.jpg\" alt=\"Mobile Support\"/>\n</p>\n\n### **10 – Organization of Third-party Tags and Codes**\n\nThere are platforms where all insertions of third-party tags and codes (Google Analytics, conversion pixels, etc.) are supported only at the beginning of the page, in many cases hindering the site's loading time. Consequently, this can be a disadvantage in an SEO project.\n\nIdeally, platforms should offer support for inserting third-party tags and codes at the bottom of the site, facilitating the loading of what really matters: the content of the site.\n\n### **11 – Handling of Custom Filters (to prevent them from being transformed into an indexable URL)**\n\nThere are several platforms that do not offer support for avoiding pagination results or filters used on the site to be indexed by search engines, harming the most relevant pages. For example:\n\n[seusite.com.br/categorias/categoria-1](http://seusite.com.br/categorias/categoria-1)\n\n[seusite.com.br/categorias/categoria-1/?ordenacao=true&pagina=3](http://seusite.com.br/categorias/categoria-1/?ordenacao=true&pagina=3)\n\nBoth URLs are indexing and being displayed in search engines. However, the only one that should be displayed is [seusite.com.br/categorias/categoria-1](http://seusite.com.br/categorias/categoria-1). The platform should have a solution so that these filter and pagination URLs are not shown in the search results.\n\n### **12 – Framework Support for Search Engines**\n\nThere are platforms that use Javascript frameworks (for more information visit: https://www.excellentwebworld.com/what-is-a-single-page-application/) to improve the user experience, making navigation more efficient and facilitating the development process. Widely used frameworks such as Angular, Vue, and React already have support for search engines to properly crawl and index all pages.\n\nHowever, there are still platforms that use frameworks that compromise the site's performance in search engines. It is extremely important to make sure that the platform has the appropriate support. Generally, this practice occurs on proprietary sites, where the company is 100% responsible for the development.\n\n### **13 - Headless Architecture**\n\nAnother important point is the use of e-commerce in a headless format, where the back-end and front-end are completely separate and integrated via API. This brings more autonomy to the development of the front-end and also creates independence from a single platform for SEO work.\n\nDeco is an example of a 100% headless platform where it is possible to integrate the front-end with the main platforms (VTEX, Linx, Shopify, VNDA, Wake), conceived enable development of an e-commerce where all SEO premises are met.\n\nCurrently, we have the Bolsas Já site being developed with the back-end in Shopify and the front-end on Deco. This gives us more autonomy to implement features and execute all the technical tasks on the front-end without impacting the operation of the e-commerce.\n\n### **14 – Organization and Availability of Products**\n\nIn most e-commerces, when a product is out of stock or permanently withdrawn from sale, both the product and its URL are removed, leading all organic visits to 404 error pages. In some platforms, the only possible option is to redirect this URL to another similar URL or to the homepage.\n\nThis practice works in the short term, until Google naturally removes the result from the organic search, since the page no longer matches the keyword. But what if we had the option to keep the URL available even with the product missing, and direct the visitor's navigation to similar products in the site?\n\nThis practice would allow the product to continue in organic searches and also continue bringing organic traffic into the site, guiding the visitor to a product close to what they were looking for.\n\n### **15 – Site Availability**\n\nShockingly, there are still large e-commerces that have to go offline for minutes or even hours during the night to run internal processes. \n\nThere is even a concern in the market regarding one of the largest Brazilian e-commerce platforms during Black Friday: the platform has been offline during the Black Friday period, leaving the sites inaccessible and compromising the performance of client sales.\n\nIf you hear from any platform that this is normal, run away! Analyze the contract well and be sure that your site is 100% available and functional. Of course, unavailability can occur, but it should be treated as an exception, not a rule. ERP update routines, integration with marketplaces, product updates, and inventory cannot stop the e-commerce under any circumstances.\n\n**Why is this bad for SEO?**\n\nImagine a site that, for some reason mentioned above, is offline daily between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. In terms of visits and revenue, it may not have such a big impact, but there is no prediction of when the indexing robots will scan the site. Surely, at some point, the site will be scanned and not be online. The consequence? Moving down on rankings and loss of organic traffic.\n\nAll e-commerce platforms have their pros and cons, and most of them will not meet all of the above requirements. So, when deciding on the platform, consider that the more support it gives, the easier it will be to execute a successful SEO project, avoiding future headaches.\n\n## **After all, what is the best e-commerce platform in terms of SEO?**\n\nWe conducted a study with the main e-commerce platforms and considered all the technical tasks we have performed on them.\n\nWe grouped all the technical tasks we have worked on and defined the following criteria: the feasibility of applying complex SEO techniques and the complexity of these technical applications. For the first, we simply considered the possibility of implementing a particular task or not. For complexity, we considered the time and effort required to perform these technical tasks.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://ozksgdmyrqcxcwhnbepg.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/assets/530/e8807f50-ead6-4661-8413-764ce9a0e495\" alt=\"SEO support quadrant\"/>\n</p>\n\nAs shown on the graph above, the few technical tasks that we managed to implement using Loja Integrada, for example, were simple and easy to apply, (robots.txt configuration, titles, meta descriptions, etc.). With Deco, it is possible to apply the largest number of technical recommendations with low implementation complexity.\n\nRemember that the platform alone will not be responsible for 100% of the success of an SEO project, but it should at least offer the support for this project to evolve satisfactorily.\n\n## **Development and Implementation Costs**\n\nBecause Deco is 100% independent and integrable with the main platforms on the market, it brings development flexibility to agencies like ours that execute SEO projects. Instead of having to become specialists in developing on specific platforms, where we have to follow guidelines that are not always favorable to our work, we can execute entire projects using Deco only, regardless of the other platforms and systems used by the client. \n\nThis flexibility has brought a different dynamic in the application of technical tasks and also changes to our business model. At Gear SEO, for example, the entire development process with Deco is based on activities and implementations and not just on hours worked. This point is positive because the price is not defined by the number of hours invested in a task, but in the resolution of each task.\n\nLikewise, there will no longer be a need for an agency specialized in a particular platform to meet the technical and SEO needs of an e-commerce. At Gear SEO, we have a complete solution for the development of the entire front-end.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nAs mentioned at the beginning of this article there is no platform that is 100% adherent to SEO technical applications. However, there are platforms that are closer to this reality. Deco, for example, is the platform closest to supporting the application of all the technical tasks we have already performed on an e-commerce platform.\n\nThe Deco platform was designed and built to meet specific SEO needs. In this scenario, Gear SEO has a specialized team in creating, developing, and maintaining e-commerces using the Deco platform.\n\nThe advantages of working with Gear SEO in the development of an e-commerce using the Deco platform are numerous:\n\n- Ability to customize the front-end through Deco's CMS module;\n\n- Gear SEO is 100% responsible for the development and maintenance of the e-commerce front-end, eliminating the need to hire multiple agencies. \n\n- Gear SEO will be able to perform all technical applications directly in the e-commerce, ensuring the quality and organization of all implementations;\n\n- Ease of integration and organization with third-party applications;\n\n- Agility in updating layout, design, and, most importantly, in monitoring technical recommendations due to the changes of search algorithms;\n\n- It is important to consider the role of SEO in a project from its conception, taking into account the work needed on each front (Strategy, On-Page, Content Production, and Link Building).\n\nThis is why an e-commerce platform should be chosen as a basis to meet SEO needs, instead of being just another acquisition channel, working partially or limitedly. A project where SEO technical recommendations work partially or limitedly is most of the time unsuccessful, especially when it comes to increasing conversion rates. \n\nDo you know of any other important points that should be considered?

Mas a principal questão é: qual é a melhor plataforma de e-commerce em termos de SEO?\n\nNós, da Gear SEO, acreditamos que essa pergunta só pode ser respondida por meio da experiência acumulada de trabalho de SEO com todas elas. Entre as plataformas com as quais trabalhamos, podemos afirmar que todas têm seus prós e contras.\n\nExistem plataformas que atendem às recomendações técnicas básicas de SEO e plataformas que atendem a quase todas as recomendações técnicas com as quais trabalhamos.\n\nDiante desse cenário, compilamos uma lista das principais recomendações técnicas que consideramos que uma plataforma de e-commerce deve conter em termos de suporte de SEO. Esta pesquisa é baseada em nossa experiência trabalhando com as principais plataformas de e-commerce ao longo dos anos.\n\nIsso será importante porque pode orientar a escolha da plataforma de acordo com os pontos que ela aborda ou os pontos que devem ser considerados no desenvolvimento de uma plataforma própria. Neste universo, consideramos tanto plataformas comerciais de e-commerce quanto plataformas de e-commerce de código aberto.\n\nTambém temos nosso e-commerce demonstrativo onde aplicamos todos os fundamentos de SEO por meio de nosso programa \"SEO na Prática\". Bolsas Já é um e-commerce headless usando a plataforma Deco com um backend Shopify.\n\n## **Quais pontos devem ser considerados?**\n\nAbaixo está uma lista com os pontos que consideramos importantes para que um e-commerce produza resultados de SEO mais eficazes, levando em consideração um projeto onde todas as páginas são trabalhadas.\n\n### **1 - Suporte Móvel**\n\nEste ponto é um dos mais importantes, se não o mais importante. É essencial que a plataforma considere um site responsivo com tempo de carregamento satisfatório.\n\nQuando falamos de um site responsivo, significa que ele deve ser o mesmo para desktop e mobile, incluindo a mesma URL. O Google já está comprometido em mudar completamente a forma como os sites são rastreados, priorizando as versões móveis de todos eles.\n\nNesta dinâmica, sites específicos para mobile ([m.site.com.br](http://m.site.com.br/)) deixarão de existir, dando lugar a sites responsivos. Na verdade, o Google já possui documentação e recomendações para essa mudança.\n\nBolsas Já é um exemplo de um aplicativo móvel 100% responsivo, atendendo a todos os requisitos técnicos de SEO.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://gearseo.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bolsasja-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"Mobile Support\"/>\n</p>\n\n### **2 - Suporte de URL**\n\nPor menos importante que possa parecer, uma plataforma que oferece suporte para personalizar as URLs o máximo possível é sempre melhor quando se trata de SEO.\n\nUm exemplo claro é uma plataforma onde as páginas de categoria devem necessariamente conter, no segundo nível, a classificação /coleção/, e os produtos devem necessariamente conter, no segundo nível, a classificação /produtos/.\n\nPor menor que seja o detalhe, estaremos em desvantagem na competição quando a plataforma oferecer mais flexibilidade na personalização de URLs, considerando que o uso da palavra-chave na URL é uma boa prática de otimização recomendada pelo Google.\n\nNo site Bolsas Já, personalizamos 100% das URLs de Categoria e Subcategoria para que todas permanecessem no primeiro nível de navegação de URL. Com isso, aumentamos a relevância das páginas em relação à página inicial.\n\nCategoria: [https://bolsasja.com.br/bolsas-femininas](https://bolsasja.com.br/bolsas-femininas)\n\nSubcategoria:\n[https://bolsasja.com.br/bolsa-casual](https://bolsasja.com.br/bolsa-casual)\n\n### **3 - Estrutura de Conteúdo**\n\nProjetos bem-sucedidos de SEO aproximam cada vez mais o e-commerce do conteúdo. Veja alguns exemplos abaixo:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://gearseo.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/estrutura-conteudos-submarino.jpg\" alt=\"Mobile Support\"/>\n</p>\n\nObserve que na página de categoria do site, há um espaço significativo para inserção de conteúdo.\n\nHoje, ter um e-commerce de um lado e um blog criado e utilizado em um subdomínio [blog.site.com.br](http://blog.site.com.br/) não é mais garantia de um trabalho de SEO bem-sucedido. Portanto, se a plataforma de e-commerce oferecer esse tipo de suporte para criação de conteúdo, será um diferencial em termos de SEO.\n\nO site Bolsas Já é um exemplo onde podemos aplicar conteúdo, imagens e elementos HTML em categorias e subcategorias, enquanto trabalhamos com os produtos ao mesmo tempo.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://gearseo.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/estrutura-conteudos-bolsasja-600x446.jpg\" alt=\"Mobile Support\"/>\n</p>\n\n### **4 - Suporte para Aplicação de Conteúdo HTML**\n\nSeguindo o exemplo acima, se a plataforma oferecer suporte para criação de uma estrutura de conteúdo em HTML no e-commerce, será possível inserir imagens, links internos e outros atributos HTML que serão favoráveis para um projeto de SEO.\n\n### **5 – Criação de Blog no Diretório**\n\nExistem plataformas que permitem a criação de componentes de conteúdo ou um blog diretamente no segundo nível da URL.\n\nExemplo: [yoursite.com.br/blog](http://yoursite.com.br/blog)\n\nEssa opção permite trabalhar com conteúdo diretamente na URL, evitando a criação de um subdomínio fora do site. Como mencionado acima, quanto mais próximo o conteúdo estiver do domínio, melhores serão as chances de resultados.\n\nO exemplo do Bolsa Já utiliza o subdiretório [Fashion Tips](https://bolsasja.com.br/dicas-de-moda/) para exibir conteúdo relacionado ao segmento dentro do próprio site, sem a necessidade de criar um subdomínio.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://gearseo.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/blog-em-subdiretorio-600x377.jpg\" alt=\"Mobile Support\"/>\n</p>\n\n### **6 – Criação de Coleção**\n\nObserve esta URL: https://www.dafiti.com.br/rasteiras-com-pedras/.\n\nBasicamente, uma coleção de produtos foi criada em uma URL personalizada que não está diretamente vinculada ao catálogo e ao menu de produtos. Isso só é possível porque a plataforma permite a criação de novas coleções de produtos sem precisar estar associada ao menu de navegação ou à árvore de categorias.\n\nCom isso, será possível criar conteúdo e coleções que não estão diretamente associadas ao menu (por exemplo, \"Roupas de Carnaval\", \"roupas para cachorro\", etc.) e aprimorar o trabalho com palavras-chave de cauda longa altamente propensas à conversão.\n\nAlém disso, também será possível criar um menu ou uma seção exclusiva para este tipo de página. O exemplo na imagem abaixo ([cea.com.br](http://cea.com.br/)) é a criação de um glossário apenas com termos que não estão contidos no menu, mas são considerados relevantes em termos de tráfego orgânico de pesquisa.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://ozksgdmyrqcxcwhnbepg.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/assets/530/f434958b-bff9-41dc-aaff-2025073669e0\" alt=\"Mobile Support\"/>\n</p>\n\n### **7 – Criação de Landing Pages Personalizadas**\n\nA https://www.kabum.com.br/hotsite/blackfriday/ é um exemplo onde é possível criar uma Landing Page 100% personalizada sem associação direta para visualização de produtos.\n\nGeralmente, essa estratégia é usada para criar páginas sazonais para conteúdo específico. Precisamente na data da ocasião (Natal, Black Friday, Dia das Mães, etc.), esta página é redirecionada para uma URL de vitrine de produtos, alavancando o tráfego orgânico desenvolvido ao longo do ano.\n\nNo site Bolsas Já, é possível criar tanto coleções quanto Landing Pages personalizadas:\n\nhttps://bolsasja.com.br/bolsa-caramelo/: Estas são coleções criadas com base em palavras-chave e volume de busca e, como explicado acima, não há relação direta com a árvore de navegação.\n\nhttps://bolsasja.com.br/bolsas-dia-das-maes: Uma Landing Page criada exclusivamente para atender a uma demanda sazonal com palavras-chave e volume de busca para um projeto de SEO.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://gearseo.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/paginas-customizadas-colecoes-600x297.jpg\" alt=\"Mobile Support\"/>\n</p>\n\n### **8 – Suporte WEBp**\n\nDe acordo com o Google (https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/faq), imagens no formato Webp têm uma redução de tamanho de até 30% em comparação com os formatos tradicionais de imagem (PNG, JPG, GIF). O próprio formato Webp já torna o site mais rápido e, consequentemente, mais vantajoso em termos de SEO. Uma plataforma que suporta esse formato é altamente recomendada.\n\n### **9 – Edição Gratuita para Meta Descrição, Títulos e Cabeçalhos**\n\nAinda hoje, existem plataformas onde os títulos e meta descrições das páginas são criados automaticamente, não permitindo personalização. Isso ocorre principalmente com as páginas de produtos, especificamente com os cabeçalhos h1.\n\nComo resultado, perdemos o controle de todos os títulos e meta descrições que excedem o limite de caracteres para exibição nos mecanismos de busca. Considere personalizar manualmente os 20% dos produtos mais importantes em seu e-commerce se você tiver muitos produtos.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://gearseo.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/titulos-metadescricoes-seo-ecommerce.jpg\" alt=\"Mobile Support\"/>\n</p>\n\n### **10 – Organização de Tags e Códigos de Terceiros**\n\nExistem plataformas onde todas as inserções de tags e códigos de terceiros (Google Analytics, pixels de conversão, etc.) são suportadas apenas no início da página, em muitos casos prejudicando o tempo de carregamento do site. Consequentemente, isso pode ser uma desvantagem em um projeto de SEO.\n\nIdealmente, as plataformas devem oferecer suporte para inserir tags e códigos de terceiros no final do site, facilitando o carregamento do que realmente importa: o conteúdo do site.\n\n### **11 – Manipulação de Filtros Personalizados (para evitar que sejam transformados em uma URL indexável)**\n\nExistem várias plataformas que não oferecem suporte para evitar que os resultados de paginação ou filtros usados no site sejam indexados pelos mecanismos de busca, prejudicando as páginas mais relevantes. Por exemplo:\n\n[seusite.com.br/categorias/categoria-1](http://seusite.com.br/categorias/categoria-1)\n\n[seusite.com.br/categorias/categoria-1/?ordenacao=true&pagina=3](http://seusite.com.br/categorias/categoria-1/?ordenacao=true&pagina=3)\n\nAmbas as URLs estão sendo indexadas e exibidas nos mecanismos de busca. No entanto, apenas a que deve ser exibida é [seusite.com.br/categorias/categoria-1](http://seusite.com.br/categorias/categoria-1). A plataforma deve ter uma solução para que essas URLs de filtro e paginação não sejam mostradas nos resultados da pesquisa.\n\n### **12 – Suporte de Framework para Mecanismos de Busca**\n\nExistem plataformas que utilizam frameworks Javascript (para mais informações, visite: https://www.excellentwebworld.com/what-is-a-single-page-application/) para melhorar a experiência do usuário, tornando a navegação mais eficiente e facilitando o processo de desenvolvimento. Frameworks amplamente utilizados como Angular, Vue e React já têm suporte para os mecanismos de busca rastrearem e indexarem corretamente todas as páginas.\n\nNo entanto, ainda existem plataformas que usam frameworks que comprometem o desempenho do site nos mecanismos de busca. É extremamente importante garantir que a plataforma tenha o suporte apropriado. Geralmente, essa prática ocorre em sites proprietários, onde a empresa é 100% responsável pelo desenvolvimento.\n\n### **13 - Arquitetura Headless**\n\nOutro ponto importante é o uso de e-commerce em um formato headless, onde o back-end e o front-end são completamente separados e integrados via API. Isso traz mais autonomia para o desenvolvimento do front-end e também cria independência de uma única plataforma para o trabalho de SEO.\n\nDeco é um exemplo de uma plataforma 100% headless onde é possível integrar o front-end com as principais plataformas (VTEX, Linx, Shopify, VNDA, Wake), concebida para permitir o desenvolvimento de um e-commerce onde todos os preceitos de SEO são atendidos.\n\nAtualmente, temos o site Bolsas Já sendo desenvolvido com o back-end no Shopify e o front-end na Deco. Isso nos dá mais autonomia para implementar recursos e executar todas as tarefas técnicas no front-end sem impactar o funcionamento do e-commerce.\n\n### **14 – Organização e Disponibilidade de Produtos**\n\nNa maioria dos e-commerces, quando um produto está fora de estoque ou é retirado permanentemente da venda, tanto o produto quanto sua URL são removidos, levando todas as visitas orgânicas a páginas de erro 404. Em algumas plataformas, a única opção possível é redirecionar essa URL para outra URL semelhante ou para a página inicial.\n\nEssa prática funciona a curto prazo, até que o Google remova naturalmente o resultado da pesquisa orgânica, pois a página não corresponde mais à palavra-chave. Mas e se tivéssemos a opção de manter a URL disponível mesmo com o produto ausente e direcionar a navegação do visitante para produtos similares no site?\n\nEssa prática permitiria que o produto continuasse nas pesquisas orgânicas e também continuasse trazendo tráfego orgânico para o site, orientando o visitante para um produto próximo ao que ele estava procurando.\n\n### **15 – Disponibilidade do Site**\n\nSurpreendentemente, ainda existem grandes e-commerces que precisam ficar offline por minutos ou até horas durante a noite para executar processos internos.\n\nHá até mesmo uma preocupação no mercado em relação a uma das maiores plataformas de e-commerce brasileiras durante a Black Friday: a plataforma ficou offline durante o período da Black Friday, deixando os sites inacessíveis e comprometendo o desempenho das vendas dos clientes.\n\nSe você ouvir de alguma plataforma que isso é normal, fuja! Analise bem o contrato e certifique-se de que seu site está 100% disponível e funcional. Claro, a indisponibilidade pode ocorrer, mas deve ser tratada como uma exceção, não uma regra. Rotinas de atualização do ERP, integração com marketplaces, atualizações de produtos e inventário não podem interromper o e-commerce sob nenhuma circunstância.\n\n**Por que isso é ruim para o SEO?**\n\nImagine um site que, por algum motivo mencionado acima, fica offline diariamente entre 2h e 3h. Em termos de visitas e receita, pode não ter um impacto tão grande, mas não há previsão de quando os robôs de indexação vão escanear o site. Certamente, em algum momento, o site será escaneado e não estará online. A consequência? Queda nos rankings e perda de tráfego orgânico.\n\nTodas as plataformas de e-commerce têm seus prós e contras, e a maioria delas não atenderá a todos os requisitos acima. Portanto, ao decidir sobre a plataforma, considere que quanto mais suporte ela oferecer, mais fácil será executar um projeto de SEO bem-sucedido, evitando dores de cabeça futuras.\n\n## **Afinal, qual é a melhor plataforma de e-commerce em termos de SEO?**\n\nRealizamos um estudo com as principais plataformas de e-commerce e consideramos todas as tarefas técnicas que realizamos nelas.\n\nAgrupamos todas as tarefas técnicas que trabalhamos e definimos os seguintes critérios: a viabilidade de aplicar técnicas de SEO complexas e a complexidade dessas aplicações técnicas. Para o primeiro, simplesmente consideramos a possibilidade de implementar uma tarefa específica ou não. Para a complexidade, consideramos o tempo e o esforço necessários para realizar essas tarefas técnicas.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://ozksgdmyrqcxcwhnbepg.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/assets/530/e8807f50-ead6-4661-8413-764ce9a0e495\" alt=\"SEO support quadrant\"/>\n</p>\n\nConforme mostrado no gráfico acima, as poucas tarefas técnicas que conseguimos implementar usando a Loja Integrada, por exemplo, foram simples e fáceis de aplicar (configuração de robots.txt, títulos, meta descrições, etc.). Com a Deco, é possível aplicar o maior número de recomendações técnicas com baixa complexidade de implementação.\n\nLembre-se de que a plataforma por si só não será responsável por 100% do sucesso de um projeto de SEO, mas deve pelo menos oferecer o suporte para que este projeto evolua satisfatoriamente.\n\n## **Custos de Desenvolvimento e Implementação**\n\nPor ser 100% independente e integrável com as principais plataformas do mercado, a Deco traz flexibilidade de desenvolvimento para agências como a nossa que executam projetos de SEO. Em vez de precisar se tornar especialistas em desenvolver em plataformas específicas, onde temos que seguir diretrizes que nem sempre são favoráveis ao nosso trabalho, podemos executar projetos inteiros usando apenas a Deco, independentemente das outras plataformas e sistemas usados pelo cliente.\n\nEssa flexibilidade trouxe uma dinâmica diferente na aplicação de tarefas técnicas e também mudanças em nosso modelo de negócios. Na Gear SEO, por exemplo, todo o processo de desenvolvimento com a Deco é baseado em atividades e implementações e não apenas em horas trabalhadas. Este ponto é positivo porque o preço não é definido pelo número de horas investidas em uma tarefa, mas na resolução de cada tarefa.\n\nDa mesma forma, não será mais necessário uma agência especializada em uma plataforma específica para atender às necessidades técnicas e de SEO de um e-commerce. Na Gear SEO, temos uma solução completa para o desenvolvimento de todo o front-end.\n\n## **Conclusão**\n\nComo mencionado no início deste artigo, não há uma plataforma que seja 100% aderente às aplicações técnicas de SEO. No entanto, existem plataformas que estão mais próximas dessa realidade. A Deco, por exemplo, é a plataforma mais próxima de oferecer suporte para a aplicação de todas as tarefas técnicas que já realizamos em uma plataforma de e-commerce.\n\nA plataforma Deco foi projetada e construída para atender às necessidades específicas de SEO. Neste cenário, a Gear SEO possui uma equipe especializada na criação, desenvolvimento e manutenção de e-commerces usando a plataforma Deco.\n\nAs vantagens de trabalhar com a Gear SEO no desenvolvimento de um e-commerce usando a plataforma Deco são numerosas:\n\n- Capacidade de personalizar o front-end por meio do módulo CMS da Deco;\n\n- A Gear SEO é 100% responsável pelo desenvolvimento e manutenção do front-end do e-commerce, eliminando a necessidade de contratar várias agências.\n\n- A Gear SEO poderá realizar todas as aplicações técnicas diretamente no e-commerce, garantindo a qualidade e organização de todas as implementações;\n\n- Facilidade de integração e organização com aplicativos de terceiros;\n\n- Agilidade na atualização do layout, design e, o mais importante, no monitoramento das recomendações técnicas devido às mudanças nos algoritmos de busca;\n\n- É importante considerar o papel do SEO em um projeto desde sua concepção, levando em conta o trabalho necessário em cada frente (Estratégia, On-Page, Produção de Conteúdo e Construção de Links).\n\nPor isso, uma plataforma de e-commerce deve ser escolhida como base para atender às necessidades de SEO, em vez de ser apenas mais um canal de aquisição, trabalhando parcialmente ou de forma limitada. Um projeto onde as recomendações técnicas de SEO funcionam parcialmente ou de forma limitada é na maioria das vezes malsucedido, especialmente quando se trata de aumentar as taxas de conversão.\n\nVocê conhece outros pontos importantes que devem ser considerados?

This is where DaisyUI comes in, a stylish and practical plugin for the popular CSS framework, Tailwind CSS. In today's post, let's dive into the world of DaisyUI and explore how incorporating its components into the 'Storefront' project can elevate our platform to new heights.\n\n## What is DaisyUI?\n\n[DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) is a component library that functions as a plugin for TailwindCSS, a highly customizable and low-level CSS framework. What DaisyUI does is bring a rich set of pre-built components that can be easily integrated and customized within a project using TailwindCSS. This means you can enjoy all the customization benefits Tailwind offers, with the speed and simplicity of a more traditional UI kit.\n\nHere's a quick example of a simple button coded without and with DaisyUI:\n\n\n### Without DaisyUI (Using only Tailwind CSS)\n\n\n```html\n<!-- Button without DaisyUI -->\n<button class=\"bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded\">\n  Click here\n</button>\n```\n\nIn this example with pure Tailwind CSS, you need to specify all the classes for button styling, from the background color (bg-blue-500 and hover:bg-blue-700 for the hover state) to the rounding of the corners (rounded).\n\n### With DaisyUI\n\n\n```html\n<!-- Botão com DaisyUI -->\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary\">\n  Click here\n</button>\n```\n\nWith DaisyUI, we simplify the markup using the btn class for basic button styling and btn-primary to apply the primary style predefined by the DaisyUI theme. The library takes care of all button interaction states, such as hover and focus, without the need to add additional classes.\n\nWhen you install DaisyUI, it provides a series of pre-defined classes that already come with a range of style settings. This allows for a substantial reduction in the code effort and increases readability at the same time.\n\n## How does DaisyUI fit into the Storefront?\n\nIt is common knowledge that our sites already have DaisyUI in them. The difference now is that with the 'daisy' components folder, you can find the UI components offered by the library adapted to become components with props in our editor.\nThese 'deco' components are advanced versions of DaisyUI components that can now be used as Preact components (a lightweight alternative to React), offering the flexibility to accept 'props' - a powerful Preact feature for passing data and configuring the component. This allows them to adapt or change according to the needs of the context in which they are used, which is especially useful for creating dynamic 'sections' in an application.\n\nFor example, if we have a Toast component, instead of using them in different ways in different contexts, you can use the Toast.tsx component that already anticipates some behavioral changes.\n\n\n```jsx\n\n<Toast message=”Hello, i am a Toast” verticalPosition=”toast-top” horizontalPosition=”toast-start” />\n\n```\n\nThis simple configuration will correctly set up your Toast in a position at the top and left.\n"},"pt":{"descr":"Descubra como essa mudança pode ajudar o desenvolvimento dos seus sites","title":"Novos componentes do Daisy UI no Storefront","content":"Quando se trata de desenvolvimento de interfaces de usuário (UI), a estética e a funcionalidade precisam andar de mãos dadas para criar uma experiência envolvente e eficiente para os usuários. É aí que entra o DaisyUI, um plugin estiloso e prático para a popular framework de CSS, Tailwind CSS. No post de hoje, vamos mergulhar no mundo do DaisyUI e explorar como a inclusão de seus componentes no projeto \"Storefront\" pode elevar nossa plataforma a novos patamares.\n\n## O Que é DaisyUI?\n\n[DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) é uma biblioteca de componentes que funciona como um plugin para TailwindCSS, um framework de CSS altamente personalizável e de baixo nível. O que o DaisyUI faz é trazer um conjunto rico de componentes pré-construídos que podem ser facilmente integrados e personalizados dentro de um projeto que utiliza TailwindCSS. Isso significa que você pode desfrutar de todos os benefícios de personalização que o Tailwind oferece, com a velocidade e simplicidade de um UI kit mais tradicional.\n\nAqui está um rápido exemplo de um botão simples codificado sem e com DaisyUI:\n\n\n### Sem DaisyUI (Usando apenas Tailwind CSS)\n\n```html\n<!-- Botão sem DaisyUI -->\n<button class=\"bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded\">\n  Clique Aqui\n</button>\n```\n\nNeste exemplo com Tailwind CSS puro, é preciso especificar todas as classes para estilização do botão, desde a cor do fundo (`bg-blue-500` e `hover:bg-blue-700` para o estado de hover) até o arredondamento das bordas (`rounded`).\n\n### Com DaisyUI\n\n```html\n<!-- Botão com DaisyUI -->\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary\">\n  Clique Aqui\n</button>\n```\n\nCom o DaisyUI, simplificamos a marcação usando a classe `btn` para um estilo básico de botão e `btn-primary` para aplicar o estilo primário predefinido pelo tema do DaisyUI. A biblioteca cuida de todos os estados de interação do botão, como hover e foco, sem a necessidade de adicionar classes adicionais.\n\nQuando você instala o DaisyUI, ele disponibiliza uma série de classes pré-definidas que já levam consigo uma série de configurações de estilo. Isso permite uma redução substancial do esforço necessário no código e aumenta a legibilidade ao mesmo tempo.\n\n## E como o Daisy UI se encontra no Storefront?\n\nÉ comum o conhecimento de que nossos sites já tem Daisy UI neles. A diferença agora é que com a pasta de componentes “daisy” você pode encontrar os componentes de UI oferecidos pela biblioteca adaptados para virarem componentes com props no nosso editor. \n\nEstes componentes 'deco' são versões avançadas dos componentes do DaisyUI que agora podem ser usados como componentes Preact (uma alternativa leve ao React), oferecendo a flexibilidade de aceitar 'props' - um recurso poderoso do Preact para passar dados e configurar o componente. Isso permite que eles se adaptem ou mudem de acordo com as necessidades do contexto em que são utilizados, o que é especialmente útil para criar 'sections' dinâmicas numa aplicação.\n\nPor exemplo, se temos um componente Toast, ao invés de  usar eles de diferentes formas em diferentes contextos, você pode usar o componente `Toast.tsx` que já prevê algumas mudanças de comportamento.\n\n\n```jsx\n\n<Toast message=”Olá, sou um Toast” verticalPosition=”toast-top” horizontalPosition=”toast-start” />\n\n```\n\nEssa simples configuração já vai configurar corretamente o seu Toast numa posição em cima e a esquerda.\n"}},"date":"22/12/2023","path":"daisy-ui-components","tags":[],"author":"Vinicius Trindade"},{"img":"https://ozksgdmyrqcxcwhnbepg.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/assets/530/d27fcd6a-1042-4729-8058-dd8c52a4b46d","body":{"en":{"descr":"Preparations, uptime, customer testimonials, and more.","title":"From challenges to breakthroughs: our remarkable Black Friday story","content":"Since it was founded in August 2022, [deco.cx](http://deco.cx/) has sustained amazing growth. Our first customer's online store was ready in May (zeedog.com.br), and by the Black Friday Cyber Monday period (November 24th to 27th, 2023) we had reached over 20 live projects.\n\n👏🏻  First of all, we want to thank our customers for their support and trust! All live projects can be seen at: [deco.cx/en/live-projects](http://deco.cx/en/live-projects)\n\nThese 20+ stores mean serious business: many are industry leaders, boasting significant traffic and GMV. Together, they have generated a total of **15M** pageviews during the BFCM period, peaking at **21:01 pm (GMT-3) on Wednesday, November 22nd.** \n\n![requests BF 1](https://github.com/deco-cx/deco/assets/134245972/9d8d159f-13d5-4bef-b23e-c28ffdbdd35a)\n\n![requests BF 2](https://github.com/deco-cx/deco/assets/134245972/8df8bea2-962b-4a13-ad3e-e3399bea78ba)\n\n![requests BF 3](https://github.com/deco-cx/deco/assets/134245972/4dc8ffae-ea6c-47ff-8baa-b2db42db2e33)\n\n_Total requests from November 20th, 2023 to November 27th, 2023_\n\nWe managed to keep our uptime at 99.99% during the BFCM period.

The reason was that [Deno](http://deno.com/), our infrastructure provider, took longer than expected to correctly escalate their infrastructure as the traffic peaked. Even though all preparations were put in place, there was an unforeseen scaling limit in their own infrastructure, which was then addressed and allowed for sufficient scaling._\n\nWe are deeply sorry for this service degradation and have taken the actions to prevent similar problems in the future. The reliability of our customer's sites is the number one priority for the Deco engineering team. Apart from this incident, we were happy with a rock-solid performance from our systems during the entire Black Friday critical sales period.\n\n## How did we prepare?\n\nThis was our first BFCM as [deco.cx](http://deco.cx/), but individually our engineers have had tons of prior experience. As we approached this key period of the year, we took some measures to guarantee our customers' success:\n\n- **Optimizing Top Traffic Stores:** We meticulously reviewed and optimized resource usage for our top traffic stores.\n\n- **Collaboration with Deno:** We became a [Deno case study](https://deno.com/blog/deco-cx-subhosting-serve-their-clients-storefronts-fast) and leveraged our relationship with them to have a direct communication channel with their leadership team, which was crucial to solve the degraded service issue as fast as possible.\n\n- **Backup Infrastructure on AWS:** We built a backup infrastructure using AWS to have a safety net in case Deno had any deeper issues.\n\n- **Enhanced Support Channel:** We introduced a new centralized [support channel on our Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/985687648595243068/1176583956573999114) for efficient communication with partners and clients in moments of high demand. \n\n## Top results\n\nAfter the BFCM period we reconvened with some of our clients to check on their experiences. Here is a glimpse of their stories:\n\n> Embelleze exceeded all ecommerce sales expectations during this BF. On the 24th, we achieved the highest sales in Embelleze's ecommerce history! This was thanks to the deco platform, which provided a practical, fast, and user-friendly shopping experience, [Tec4u](https://www.tec4udigital.com/), which supported us in the transition to deco, and [Sourei](http://sourei.com.br/)'s expertise, that allowed us to optimize our media spend and have full observability of the results. These changes led to a 125% increase in our Return on Investment (ROI) and a remarkable 144% growth in revenue. \n\n<div align=\"right\">- Aline Augusto, Head of ecommerce, marketplace and media at [Embelleze](http://embelleze.com/)</div>\n\n![Embelleze graph 2](https://github.com/deco-cx/deco/assets/134245972/a1fe8db7-801c-42b7-9aaa-6a95c432108e)\n_Graph showing revenue from Embelleze's ecommerce in the 24 hours of BF 2023.

This year, we chose to dose down on our promotion strategy with less expressive discounts. Even so, we exceeded our original target (to maintain last year's results), increasing our sales in 15%! \n\n<div align=\"right\">- Guilherme Ladowsky, Partner at [Aviator](http://aviator.com.br/)</div>\n\n> We migrated to deco on September and the impact on performance was instantaneous - we went from an average PageSpeed of 20 on mobile to over 80.

Nossa primeira loja foi para o ar em maio (zeedog.com.br), e até o período da Black Friday e Cyber Monday (24 a 27 de novembro de 2023) alcançamos mais de 20 projetos _live_.\n\n👏🏻 Em primeiro lugar, queremos agradecer aos nossos clientes pelo apoio e confiança! Todos os projetos _live_ podem ser vistos em: [deco.cx/pt/projetos-ao-vivo](http://deco.cx/en/live-projects)\n\nEstamos muito orgulhosos das mais de 20 marcas que estão na nossa plataforma: muitas são líderes de suas indústrias, com tráfego e GMV significativos. Juntas, geraram um total de **15M** de visualizações de página durante o período BFCM, atingindo o pico às **21:01 (GMT-3) na quarta-feira, 22 de novembro.**\n\n![pedidos BF 1](https://github.com/deco-cx/deco/assets/134245972/9d8d159f-13d5-4bef-b23e-c28ffdbdd35a)\n\n![pedidos BF 2](https://github.com/deco-cx/deco/assets/134245972/8df8bea2-962b-4a13-ad3e-e3399bea78ba)\n\n![pedidos BF 3](https://github.com/deco-cx/deco/assets/134245972/4dc8ffae-ea6c-47ff-8baa-b2db42db2e33)\n\n_Requisições totais de 20 a 27 de novembro de 2023_\n\nConseguimos manter nosso _uptime_ em 99,99% durante o período BFCM. No entanto, enfrentamos uma [degradação de desempenho por 1 hora na noite de quarta-feira,](https://deco.instatus.com/clpagkpn724079bbom1qcbc3fh) em que um de nossos clientes experimentou até 30% de falhas nas requisições para “adicionar ao carrinho” e navegação mais lenta.\n\n⚠️ _Isso significa que, enquanto o incidente ocorreu, uma parcela dos visitantes teve uma experiência de compra abaixo da média. O motivo foi que [Deno](http://deno.com/), nosso provedor de infraestrutura, demorou mais do que o esperado para escalar corretamente sua infraestrutura à medida que o tráfego aumentava. Embora todos os preparativos estivessem no lugar, houve um limite imprevisto em sua própria infraestrutura, que foi então abordado e permitiu um escalonamento suficiente._\n\nLamentamos profundamente essa degradação do serviço e tomamos as medidas para evitar problemas semelhantes no futuro. A confiabilidade dos sites de nossos clientes é a prioridade número um para a equipe de engenharia da Deco.

Segue um pouco de suas histórias:\n\n> A Embelleze superou todas as expectativas de vendas no ecommerce durante esta BF. No dia 24, alcançamos as maiores vendas da história da loja virtual da Embelleze! Isso foi graças à plataforma deco, que proporcionou uma experiência de compra prática, rápida e amigável ao usuário, a [Tec4u](https://www.tec4udigital.com/), que nos apoiou na transição para deco, e a expertise da [Sourei](http://sourei.com.br/), que nos permitiu otimizar nossos gastos com mídia e ter total observabilidade dos resultados.

With ecommerce APIs often experiencing latency between 1 to 7 seconds, crafting a rendering engine that responds in a sub-second timescale requires a meticulously designed caching layer. Today, we're excited to announce a pivotal shift in how stale caching operates on deco.cx, introducing a simpler API for developers and significantly improving observability.\n\nIn the past, utilizing deco.cx's stale caching layer meant developers had to employ a custom `fetch` implementation provided by the deco.cx framework. This custom fetch modified the fetched URL, routing the request through deco's CDN and incorporating stale caching. For example, when fetching `https://example.com`, the framework would actually retrieve `https://decocache.com?src=\"https://example.com\"`. However, with the growing number of apps on decohub, some services already provided libraries for interacting with their APIs, rendering our custom fetch implementation impractical. Moreover, integrating tracing was challenging due to the framework's lack of control over HTTP connections. Consequently, we're transitioning away from the custom `fetch` implementation, relocating the caching layer to our loaders. This new API offers seamless support for both stale caching and tracing.\n\n## Opting into the New Features: A Simplified Transition Process\n\nTo start using the new loaders API, set the environment variable:\n\n```sh\nexport ENABLE_LOADER_CACHE=true\n```\n\n## Enable Stale Caching\n\nBy default, stale caching remains inactive in loaders. Activating this feature requires a simple modification in your loader's code:\n\n```ts\n// ... loader code\n\nexport const cache = 'stale-while-revalidate'\n```\n\nYou have the option to set the cache variable to either `stale-while-revalidate` or `no-store`, with the default being `no-store`.\n\nNow, your loader is stale cached! To confirm, open a page where your loader is used, add a `?__d` query string to the URL, and observe tracing information in the terminal, including cache states such as `HIT`, `MISS`, `STALE`, and `BYPASS`.\n\n```sh\n[200] 1312ms /camisa-masc-classic-linen-ml-verde-forest-46661-206/p\n[====================] 1312ms 200 /camisa-masc-classic-linen-ml-verde-forest-46661-206/p\n[ ] 0ms load-page\n[ ] 23ms router\n[ ===================] 1234ms load-data\n[ ===================] 1233ms Product Page@sections\n[ ] 0ms PDP Loader@data.slug\n[ ===================] 1231ms STALE PDP Loader@extensions.0\n[ ] 47ms render-to-string\n```\n\n**HIT**: Cache considered fresh (standard max-age: 60 seconds). **STALE**: Cache not fresh, but stale content served (background validation triggered). **MISS**: Loader is cacheable, but data not in the cache. **BYPASS**: Loader not cacheable, possibly due to specific configurations.\n\nNote that the cache key varies with the props content passed to the loader. To vary the loader's response with the `Request` object, read the next section.\n\n## Varying the Cache\n\nSome loaders may need to vary based on properties available only in the `Request` object, such as query strings, cookies, etc. To achieve this, open your loader's file and export the `cacheKey` function:\n\n```ts\nexport const cacheKey = (req: Request, ctx: AppContext): string => '';\n```\n\nThis function allows the developer to precisely describe how the cache should vary.\n\n\n## Example\n\nTo illustrate, let's consider a practical scenario. Suppose you're building a loader for fetching a paginated response, with the pagination information stored in a `?page=` parameter. Here's how you can correctly implement this loader:\n\n```ts\ninterface Props {\n  // ... loader props\n}\n\nconst loader = (props: Props, req: Request, ctx: AppContext) {\n  // Implementation details for fetching paginated response\n}\n\nexport const cache = 'stale-while-revalidate'\n\n// Vary the cache with the page parameter\nexport const cacheKey = (req: Request, ctx: AppContext) => {\n  const url = new URL(req.url)\n  return url.searchParams.get('page')\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `loader` function encapsulates the logic for fetching a paginated response, while the `cache` setting ensures stale-while-revalidate caching. The `cacheKey` function intelligently varies the cache based on the `page` parameter, allowing for a dynamic and efficient caching strategy tailored to your specific use case.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThese changes mark the beginning of forthcoming improvements in both performance and observability for websites built on deco.cx. We'll commence testing this new feature and gradually roll it out for our customers by default.\n\nFor more info, check out the [original PR](https://github.com/deco-cx/deco/pull/502) on GitHub."},"pt":{"seo":{"title":"Nova API de Loaders: Aprimorando Stale Caching e Tracing","description":"Mudanças na camada de cache da deco e melhorias no tracing"},"descr":"Mudanças na camada de cache da deco e melhorias no tracing","title":"Nova API de Loaders: Aprimorando Stale Caching e Tracing","content":"## Introdução\n\nStale caching tem sido há muito tempo o segredo por trás da velocidade e confiabilidade dos sites deco.cx. Com APIs de comércio eletrônico frequentemente enfrentando latência entre 1 a 7 segundos, criar um mecanismo de renderização que responda em uma escala de sub-segundos requer uma camada de caching meticulosamente projetada. Hoje, estamos animados em anunciar uma mudança fundamental na forma como o stale caching opera no deco.cx, introduzindo uma API mais simples para desenvolvedores e melhorando significativamente a observabilidade.\n\nNo passado, utilizar a camada de stale caching do deco.cx significava que os desenvolvedores tinham que empregar uma implementação customizada de `fetch` fornecida pelo framework deco.cx. Esse fetch customizado modificava a URL solicitada, direcionando a requisição através do CDN do deco e incorporando stale caching. Por exemplo, ao buscar `https://example.com`, o framework realmente recuperaria `https://decocache.com?src=\"https://example.com\"`. No entanto, com o crescente número de aplicativos no decohub, alguns serviços já forneciam bibliotecas para interagir com suas APIs, tornando impraticável nossa implementação customizada de `fetch`. Além disso, a integração do tracing era desafiadora devido à falta de controle do framework sobre as conexões HTTP. Consequentemente, estamos nos afastando da implementação customizada de `fetch`, realocando a camada de caching para nossos loaders. Esta nova API oferece suporte perfeito tanto para o stale caching quanto para o tracing.\n\n## Optando pelas Novas Funcionalidades: Um Processo de Transição Simplificado\n\nPara começar a usar a nova API de loaders, configure a variável de ambiente:\n\n```sh\nexport ENABLE_LOADER_CACHE=true\n```\n\n## Habilitar o Stale Caching\n\nPor padrão, o stale caching permanece inativo nos loaders. Ativar essa funcionalidade requer uma modificação simples no código do seu loader:\n\n```ts\n// ... código do loader\n\nexport const cache = 'stale-while-revalidate'\n```\n\nVocê tem a opção de configurar a variável de cache para `stale-while-revalidate` ou `no-store`, sendo o padrão `no-store`.\n\nAgora, seu loader está com stale caching! Para confirmar, abra uma página onde seu loader é usado, adicione uma string de consulta `?__d` à URL e observe as informações de tracing no terminal, incluindo os estados de cache como `HIT`, `MISS`, `STALE` e `BYPASS`.\n\n```sh\n[200] 1312ms /camisa-masc-classic-linen-ml-verde-forest-46661-206/p\n[====================] 1312ms 200 /camisa-masc-classic-linen-ml-verde-forest-46661-206/p\n[ ] 0ms load-page\n[ ] 23ms router\n[ ===================] 1234ms load-data\n[ ===================] 1233ms Product Page@sections\n[ ] 0ms PDP Loader@data.slug\n[ ===================] 1231ms STALE PDP Loader@extensions.0\n[ ] 47ms render-to-string\n```\n\n**HIT**: Cache considerado fresco (max-age padrão: 60 segundos). **STALE**: Cache não está fresco, mas conteúdo antigo servido (validação em segundo plano acionada). **MISS**: Loader é cacheável, mas dados não estão no cache. **BYPASS**: Loader não é cacheável, possivelmente devido a configurações específicas.\n\nObserve que a chave de cache varia com o conteúdo de props passado para o loader. Para variar a resposta do loader com o objeto `Request`, leia a próxima seção.\n\n## Variando o Cache\n\nAlguns loaders podem precisar variar com base em propriedades disponíveis apenas no objeto `Request`, como strings de consulta, cookies, etc. Para alcançar isso, abra o arquivo do seu loader e exporte a função `cacheKey`:\n\n```ts\nexport const cacheKey = (req: Request, ctx: AppContext): string => '';\n```\n\nEssa função permite que o desenvolvedor descreva precisamente como o cache deve variar.\n\n## Exemplo\n\nPara ilustrar, considere um cenário prático. Suponha que você esteja construindo um loader para buscar uma resposta paginada, com informações de paginação armazenadas em um parâmetro `?page=`. Veja como você pode implementar corretamente esse loader:\n\n```ts\ninterface Props {\n  // ... props do loader\n}\n\nconst loader = (props: Props, req: Request, ctx: AppContext) {\n  // Detalhes de implementação para buscar resposta paginada\n}\n\nexport const cache = 'stale-while-revalidate'\n\n// Varie o cache com o parâmetro de página\nexport const cacheKey = (req: Request, ctx: AppContext) => {\n  const url = new URL(req.url)\n  return url.searchParams.get('page')\n}\n```\n\nNeste exemplo, a função `loader` encapsula a lógica para buscar uma resposta paginada, enquanto a configuração `cache` garante caching stale-while-revalidate. A função `cacheKey` varia inteligentemente o cache com base no parâmetro `page`, permitindo uma estratégia de caching dinâmica e eficiente adaptada ao seu caso de uso específico.\n\n## Conclusão\n\nEssas mudanças marcam o início de melhorias futuras tanto em desempenho quanto em observabilidade para sites construídos no deco.cx. Vamos começar a testar esse novo recurso e implementá-lo gradualmente para nossos clientes por padrão.\n\nPara mais informações, confira o [PR original](https://github.com/deco-cx/deco/pull/502) no GitHub."}},"date":"05/12/2023","path":"new-loaders-api","tags":["loaders"],"author":"Tiago Gimenes","authorAvatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1753396?v=4"},{"img":"https://ozksgdmyrqcxcwhnbepg.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/assets/530/10a6a987-e88a-4d3b-b915-a6346d16f43c","body":{"en":{"seo":{"image":"https://ozksgdmyrqcxcwhnbepg.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/assets/530/5160315f-a46c-4e15-977a-29f70ad7cc40"},"descr":"Nuvemshop is now available on deco.cx","title":"Nuvemshop Integration","content":"We're thrilled to bring you the latest chapter in our journey to streamline your e-commerce experience.

To help you make the most of this shopping period, we've compiled a list of essential tasks to ensure that your online store is fully prepared for Black Friday 2023.\n\n## Adopt Ahead-of-Time Builds\n\nFresh recently introduced an innovative feature called \"ahead of time builds,\" designed to transform how you create and deliver your website. This approach not only stabilizes your store's JavaScript but also significantly improves server boot times. To fully understand this new approach, you can explore the structured documentation provided by Fresh [here](https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/concepts/ahead-of-time-builds).\n\nAt [Deco.cx](http://deco.cx/), we strongly recommend adopting the ahead-of-time version because it provides scalability to your server, which is essential for handling the demands of events like Black Friday. To migrate to this new version, instruct your developer to perform the update using the following command:\n\n```sh\ndeno run -Ar https://deco.cx/upgrade\n```\n\nAfter> completing the update, make sure that:\n\n1. Your store is functioning correctly, including checking the home, product detail (PDP), and product listing (PLP) pages, as well as verifying the add-to-cart functionality and any other critical flows.\n2. Administrative editing is working smoothly, allowing you to edit your store's sections and publish them.\n\nIf your store is already online, the [Deco.cx](http://deco.cx/) team has already run this command for you. To verify, ask your developer to look for a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub with the title \"Preparations for Black Friday.\" If you encounter any issues during this process, don't hesitate to contact us on [Deco.cx Discord](https://deco.cx/discord).\n\n## Support for Mobile Safari\n\nA few months ago, we shared a blog post detailing the [lessons we've learned](https://www.deco.cx/en/blog/licoes-6-meses.md) from our stores in production. We strongly recommend implementing all the suggestions mentioned in the post before Black Friday. However, one of the most critical steps is to ensure that your store functions seamlessly on Safari versions 12, 13, and 14.\n\nTo achieve this, follow these steps:\n\n1. Verify that your `fresh.config.ts` file includes the Safari12 build target.\n2. Ensure that your website does not use the `<dialog>` tag.\n\nEngage your developer to make the necessary adjustments to remove the `<dialog>` tag and set Safari12 as the build target. We recommend performing this step after migrating to ahead-of-time builds to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nAs we kick off the holiday shopping season, the [Deco.cx](http://deco.cx/) team is dedicated to providing stability and reliability during this critical period. Starting this week, we will be actively working on stability improvements to enhance your experience on Black Friday. It's crucial to stay up-to-date with the latest Deco versions and keep an eye out for more informative posts on how to optimize your online store for success on Black Friday."},"pt":{"seo":{"image":"https://ozksgdmyrqcxcwhnbepg.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/assets/530/8242aca6-5215-4321-8e9d-f876fc1d1d58","title":"Black Friday 2023","description":"Checklist para uma Black Friday tranquila","canonical":"/black-friday-2023"},"descr":"Checklist para uma Black Friday tranquila","title":"Como se preparar para a Black Friday 2023","content":"A Black Friday está chegando e é uma oportunidade incrível para as marcas aumentarem suas vendas. Para ajudar você a aproveitar ao máximo esse período de compras, compilamos uma lista de tarefas essenciais para garantir que sua loja online esteja totalmente preparada para a Black Friday 2023.\n\n## Adote a Compilação Ahead-of-Time\n\nO Fresh recentemente introduziu um recurso inovador chamado \"compilações _ahead-of-time_\", projetado para transformar como você cria e entrega seu site. Essa abordagem não apenas estabiliza o JavaScript da sua loja, mas também melhora significativamente os tempos de inicialização do servidor. Para entender essa nova abordagem completamente, você pode explorar a documentação estruturada fornecida pelo Fresh **[aqui](https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/concepts/ahead-of-time-builds)**.\n\nNa [deco.cx](http://deco.cx/), recomendamos fortemente a adoção da versão _ahead-of-time_, pois ela fornece escalabilidade ao seu servidor, o que é essencial para lidar com as demandas de eventos como a Black Friday. Para migrar para essa nova versão, instrua seu desenvolvedor a realizar a atualização usando o seguinte comando:\n\n```sh\ndeno run -Ar https://deco.cx/upgrade\n```\n\nApós concluir a atualização, certifique-se de que:\n\n1. Sua loja está funcionando corretamente, incluindo a verificação das páginas inicial, detalhes do produto (PDP) e listagem de produtos (PLP), além de verificar a funcionalidade de adicionar ao carrinho e quaisquer outros fluxos críticos.\n2. A edição administrativa está funcionando sem problemas, permitindo que você edite as seções da sua loja e as publique.\n\nSe sua loja já estiver online, a equipe do [deco.cx](http://deco.cx/) já executou esse comando para você. Para verificar, peça ao seu desenvolvedor para procurar um Pull Request (PR) no GitHub com o título \"Preparations for Black Friday\". Se encontrar algum problema durante esse processo, não hesite em nos contatar no [deco.cx discord](https://deco.cx/discord).\n\n## Suporte ao Mobile Safari\n\nHá alguns meses, compartilhamos um post no blog detalhando as **[lições que aprendemos](https://www.deco.cx/en/blog/licoes-6-meses.md)** com nossas lojas em produção. Recomendamos fortemente a implementação de todas as sugestões mencionadas no post antes da Black Friday. No entanto, um dos passos mais importantes é garantir que sua loja funcione perfeitamente nas versões 12, 13 e 14 do Safari.\n\nPara isso, siga estas etapas:\n\n1. Verifique se seu arquivo **`fresh.config.ts`** inclui o destino de compilação Safari12.\n2. Certifique-se de que seu site não usa a tag **`<dialog>`**.\n\nPeça ao seu desenvolvedor para fazer os ajustes necessários para remover a tag **`<dialog>`** e configurar o Safari12 como destino de compilação.

During this period, we have learned what to avoid, what doesn't work, and the best way to start developing an online store. Below, we share a summary of the lessons we have acquired during this journey.\n\n## **Starting the Development of a Store**\n\nAll projects created at Deco start from a pre-configured template with various components, integrations, and themes. We have noticed that after creating the store, some developers turn to GitHub to modify components and themes directly in the code. Although this is a natural reflex for a developer's work, we have noticed that projects in which development mainly focuses on the CMS (Content Management System) tend to be completed more quickly and with better performance.\n\nThe ideal flow that we have discovered is as follows:\n\n1. Create the project.\n2. Customize the theme, components, SEO optimization, among others through the Deco admin.\n3. Present the result to the end client and collect feedback.\n4. Based on the feedback, adjust the store in the CMS, using the predefined sections, and return to step 3.\n5. If the client is satisfied, migrate the domain to Deco.\n6. If it is necessary to make changes in the code, add specific sections for the use case in question.\n\n## **The `<dialog>` Tag**\n\nIn previous versions of our templates, we used the HTML5 tag **`<dialog>`**. This tag allowed the creation of modals with accessibility support. However, we identified two main problems related to it:\n\n1. It required JavaScript to work properly, which went against our philosophy of minimizing the use of JavaScript on the page.\n2. Recent versions of iPhones (10, 11, and 12) do not support this tag, which forced us to insert \"polyfills\". This insertion was synchronous and significantly affected the performance of the websites.\n\nDue to these two mentioned points, we have adopted an alternative approach using the **`<input type=\"checkbox>`** tag, which is widely supported by all browsers. This change solved both problems. We migrated our templates to this technique and observed an increase in compatibility between our websites and mobile devices.\n\nIf your website is still using the **`<dialog>`** tag, we recommend migrating to **`<input type=\"checkbox>`** as soon as possible to avoid incompatibilities with iPhones. For more information about this approach, please refer to **[this link](https://daisyui.com/components/modal/#method-2-using-a-hidden-checkbox-legacy)**.\n\n## **Absolute Units**\n\nWe noticed that some of our stores had conversion rates below expectations on certain devices, especially iPhones and Android devices. After a deeper analysis, we identified that the \"Go to checkout\" button was being hidden by the browser's address bar in Chrome and Safari on some of these devices.\n\nThis problem occurred due to the use of absolute units, such as **`vh`** (viewport height) and **`vw`** (viewport width), instead of relative units. Absolute units refer to the total size of the device's screen, not taking into account the rendering area of the window, which can hide parts of the user interface.\n\nTo avoid this type of problem, it is essential to avoid the use of absolute units such as **`vh`** and **`vw`**. We recommend reviewing your store to ensure that these units are not being used, especially in the minicart.\n\n## **Flexbox and Percentage Units**\n\nAnother problem that we identified in some stores relates to broken layouts in older versions of Safari. This usually occurs when percentage units are used in conjunction with flexbox. An example of this is the following code snippet:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"flex\">\n   <div class=\"w-full\"/>\n</div>\n\n```\n\nIn this example, we are combining flexbox (class **`flex`**) with percentage units (**`width: 100%`**). This may work in newer browsers but causes issues in older versions of Safari, such as iPhone 10, 11, and 12.\n\nTo solve this problem, we recommend replacing **`w-full`** with classes related to flexbox:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"flex\">\n   <div class=\"flex-grow\"/>\n</div>\n\n```\n\nThis will ensure that the layout works correctly in all browsers.\n\nWe are always keeping up with new projects, collecting feedback, and improving the **[Storefront](https://github.com/deco-sites/storefront)** template.","seo":{"image":"https://ozksgdmyrqcxcwhnbepg.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/assets/530/1bc67d75-698c-4d38-9035-64b097273881","title":"6 months of stores in production","description":"A journey of learning"}},"pt":{"descr":"Uma jornada de aprendizados","title":"6 meses de lojas em produçāo","content":"Nos últimos seis meses acumulamos um valioso conjunto de lições ao levar lojas para produção. Nesse período, aprendemos o que deve ser evitado, o que não funciona e a melhor maneira de iniciar o desenvolvimento de uma loja online. A seguir, compartilhamos um resumo das lições que adquirimos durante essa jornada.\n\n## Início do Desenvolvimento de uma Loja\n\nTodos projetos criados na Deco partem de um template pré-configurado com diversos componentes, integrações e temas. Observamos que, após criar a loja, alguns desenvolvedores recorrem ao GitHub para modificar componentes e temas diretamente no código. Embora isso seja um reflexo natural do trabalho de um desenvolvedor, notamos que os projetos nos quais o desenvolvimento se concentra principalmente no CMS (Content Management System) tendem a ser concluídos mais rapidamente e com melhor desempenho.\n\nO fluxo que descobrimos ser o ideal é o seguinte:\n\n1. Criar o projeto.\n2. Personalizar o tema, componentes, otimização de SEO, entre outros através do admin da deco.\n3. Apresentar o resultado ao cliente final e coletar feedback.\n4. Com base no feedback, ajustar a loja no CMS, usando as seções predefinidas e voltar ao passo 3.\n6. Se o cliente estiver satisfeito, migrar o domínio para a Deco.\n7. Caso seja necessário fazer alterações no código, adicionar seções específicas para o caso de uso em questão.\n\n## A Tag `<dialog>`\n\nEm versões anteriores de nossos templates, utilizávamos a tag HTML5 `<dialog>`. Essa tag permitia a criação de modais com suporte à acessibilidade. No entanto, identificamos dois problemas principais relacionados a ela:\n\n1. Exigia JavaScript para funcionar corretamente, o que ia de encontro à nossa filosofia de minimizar o uso de JavaScript na página.\n2. Versões recentes do iPhone (10, 11 e 12) não oferecem suporte a essa tag, o que nos forçava a inserir \"polyfills\". Essa inserção era síncrona e prejudicava significativamente o desempenho dos sites.\n\nDevido a esses dois pontos mencionados, adotamos uma abordagem alternativa usando a tag `<input type=\"checkbox>`, que é amplamente suportada por todos os navegadores. Essa mudança resolveu ambos os problemas. Migramos nossos templates para essa técnica e observamos um aumento na compatibilidade entre nossos sites e dispositivos móveis.\n\nSe o seu site ainda estiver usando a tag `<dialog>`, recomendamos fazer a migração o mais rápido possível para `<input type=\"checkbox>` para evitar incompatibilidades com iPhones. Para obter mais informações sobre essa abordagem, consulte [este link](https://daisyui.com/components/modal/#method-2-using-a-hidden-checkbox-legacy).\n\n## Unidades absolutas\n\nPercebemos que algumas de nossas lojas apresentavam taxas de conversão abaixo do esperado em determinados dispositivos, especialmente em iPhones e dispositivos Android. Após uma análise mais aprofundada, identificamos que o botão \"Ir para o checkout\" estava sendo ocultado pela barra de endereços dos navegadores Chrome e Safari em alguns desses dispositivos.\n\nEsse problema ocorreu devido ao uso de unidades absolutas, como `vh` (viewport height) e `vw` (viewport width), em vez de unidades relativas. As unidades absolutas fazem referência ao tamanho total da tela do dispositivo, não levando em consideração a área de renderização da janela, o que pode ocultar partes da interface do usuário.\n\nPara evitar esse tipo de problema, é fundamental evitar o uso de unidades absolutas, como `vh` e `vw`. Recomendamos revisar sua loja para garantir que essas unidades não estejam sendo usadas, especialmente no minicart.\n\n## Flexbox e Unidades Percentuais\n\nOutro problema que identificamos em algumas lojas diz respeito ao layout quebrado em versões mais antigas do Safari. Isso ocorre geralmente quando unidades percentuais são usadas em conjunto com flexbox. Um exemplo disso é o seguinte trecho de código:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"flex\">\n   <div class=\"w-full\"/>\n</div>\n```\n\nNesse exemplo, estamos combinando flexbox (classe `flex`) com unidades percentuais (`width: 100%`). Isso pode funcionar em navegadores mais recentes, mas causa problemas em versões mais antigas do Safari, como o iPhone 10, 11 e 12.\n\nPara solucionar esse problema, recomendamos substituir `w-full` por classes relacionadas ao flexbox:\n\n ```html\n<div class=\"flex\">\n   <div class=\"flex-grow\"/>\n</div>\n```\n\nIsso garantirá que o layout funcione corretamente em todos os navegadores.\n\n\nEstamos sempre acompanhando os novos projetos, coletando os apresentados e melhorando o template [Storefront](https://github.com/deco-sites/storefront).","seo":{"image":"https://github.com/deco-cx/blog/assets/1753396/20fb996b-4d04-417c-af69-5beb2a7e7969","title":"6 meses de lojas em produçāo - Uma jornada de aprendizados","description":"Nos últimos seis meses acumulamos um valioso conjunto de lições ao levar lojas para produção.

One of the reasons why pages created in Deco are so efficient is due to the island architecture. This architecture allows developers to remove non-interactive parts of the final JavaScript package, reducing the total amount of JavaScript on the page and freeing up the browser to perform other tasks.\n\nHowever, one of the limitations of this architecture is that very complex pages, with a lot of interactivity and therefore many islands, still require a large amount of JavaScript. Fortunately, this limitation is now a thing of the past, thanks to the introduction of Partials.\n\n## How It Works\n\nPartials, inspired by [htmx](https://htmx.org/docs/), operate with a runtime that intercepts user interactions with button, anchor, and form elements. These interactions are sent to our server, which calculates the new state of the page and responds to the browser. The browser receives the new UI state in pure HTML, which is then processed and the differences are applied, changing the page to its final state. For more detailed information about Partials, see the [Fresh documentation](https://github.com/denoland/fresh/issues/1609).\n\n## Partials in Action\n\nWe are migrating the components of the Deco store to the new Partials solution. So far, we have migrated the SKU selector, which can be viewed in action [here](http://storefront-vtex.deco.site/camisa-masculina-xadrez-sun-e-azul/p?skuId=120). More changes, such as `infinite scroll` and improvements to filters, are coming soon.\n\nAnother unlocked feature is the ability to create folds on the page. E-commerce pages are usually long and contain many elements. Browsers often face problems when there are many elements in the HTML. To deal with this, the fold technique was invented.\n\nThe basic idea of this technique is to divide the content of the page into two parts: the content above and the content below the fold. The content above the fold is loaded on the first request to the server. The content below the fold is loaded as soon as the first request is completed. This type of functionality used to be difficult to implement in older architectures. Fortunately, we have embedded this logic in a new section called `Deferred`. This section accepts a list of sections as a parameter that should have their loading delayed until a later time.\n\nTo use this new section:\n\n1. Access the Deco administration panel and add the `Rendering > Deferred` section to your page.\n2. Move the sections you want to defer to the `Deferred` section.\n3. Save and publish the page.\n4. Done! The sections are now deferred without the need to change the code!\n\nSee `Deferred` in action at this [link](https://storefront-vtex.deco.site/home-partial).\n\n> Note that, for the `Deferred` section to appear, you must be on the latest version of `fresh`, `apps`, and deco!\n\nA question you may be asking yourself now is: How do I choose the sections I should include in the deferred? To do this, use the performance tab and start with the heaviest sections that offer the greatest return!\n\nFor more information, see our [docs](https://www.deco.cx/docs/en/developing/partial)"},"pt":{"descr":"Revolucionando o Desenvolvimento Web","title":"Partials","content":"[Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/), o framework web utilizado pela Deco, é conhecido por possibilitar a criação de páginas de altíssimo desempenho. Uma das razões pelas quais as páginas criadas na Deco são tão eficientes é devido à arquitetura de ilhas. Essa arquitetura permite que os desenvolvedores removam partes não interativas do pacote final de JavaScript, reduzindo a quantidade total de JavaScript na página e aliviando o navegador para realizar outras tarefas.\n\nNo entanto, uma das limitações dessa arquitetura é que páginas muito complexas, com muita interatividade e, portanto, muitas ilhas, ainda exigem uma grande quantidade de JavaScript. Felizmente, essa limitação agora é coisa do passado, graças à introdução dos Partials.\n\n## Como Funciona?\n\nOs Partials, inspirados no [htmx](https://htmx.org/docs/), operam com um runtime que intercepta as interações do usuário com elementos de botão, âncora e formulário. Essas interações são enviadas para nosso servidor, que calcula o novo estado da página e responde ao navegador. O navegador recebe o novo estado da IU em HTML puro, que é então processado e as diferenças são aplicadas, alterando a página para o seu estado final. Para obter informações mais detalhadas sobre os Partials, consulte a [documentação](https://github.com/denoland/fresh/issues/1609) do Fresh.\n\n## Partials em Ação\n\nEstamos migrando os componentes da loja da Deco para a nova solução de Partials. Até o momento, migramos o seletor de SKU, que pode ser visualizado em ação [aqui](http://storefront-vtex.deco.site/camisa-masculina-xadrez-sun-e-azul/p?skuId=120). Mais mudanças, como `infinite scroll` e melhorias nos filtros, estão por vir.\n\nOutra funcionalidade desbloqueada é a possibilidade de criar dobras na página. As páginas de comércio eletrônico geralmente são longas e contêm muitos elementos. Os navegadores costumam enfrentar problemas quando há muitos elementos no HTML. Para lidar com isso, foi inventada a técnica de dobra.\n\nA ideia básica dessa técnica é dividir o conteúdo da página em duas partes: o conteúdo acima e o conteúdo abaixo da dobra. O conteúdo acima da dobra é carregado na primeira solicitação ao servidor. O conteúdo abaixo da dobra é carregado assim que a primeira solicitação é concluída. Esse tipo de funcionalidade costumava ser difícil de implementar em arquiteturas mais antigas. Felizmente, embutimos essa lógica em uma nova seção chamada `Deferred`. Esta seção aceita uma lista de seções como parâmetro que devem ter seu carregamento adiado para um momento posterior.\n\nPara usar essa nova seção:\n\n1. Acesse o painel de administração da Deco e adicione a seção `Rendering > Deferred` à sua página.\n2. Mova as seções que deseja adiar para a seção `Deferred`.\n3. Salve e publique a página.\n4. Pronto! As seções agora estão adiadas sem a necessidade de alterar o código!\n\nVeja `Deferred` em ação neste [link](https://storefront-vtex.deco.site/home-partial).\n\n> Observe que, para a seção `Deferred` aparecer, você deve estar na versão mais recente do `fresh`, `apps` e deco!\n\nUma pergunta que você pode estar se fazendo agora é: Como escolher as seções que devo incluir no deferred? Para isso, use a aba de desempenho e comece pelas seções mais pesadas que oferecem o maior retorno!\n\nPara mais informações, veja nossas [docs](https://www.deco.cx/docs/en/developing/partial)"}},"date":"06/10/2023","path":"partials.md","author":"Marcos Candeia, Tiago Gimenes"},{"img":"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121065272/278021874-91a4ffea-3a22-4631-a4b3-c21bbc056386.png","body":{"en":{"descr":"Como a Lojas Torra dobrou sua taxa de conversão após migrar o front do seu ecommerce para a deco.cx","title":"A nova fase da Lojas Torra com a deco.cx."},"pt":{"descr":"Como a Lojas Torra dobrou sua taxa de conversão após migrar o front do seu ecommerce para a deco.cx","title":"A nova fase da Lojas Torra com a deco.cx."}},"date":"31/08/2023","path":"case-lojas-torra","author":"Por Maria Cecilia Marques"},{"img":"https://ozksgdmyrqcxcwhnbepg.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/assets/530/5a07de58-ba83-4c6c-92e1-bea033350318","body":{"en":{"descr":"Discover how our headless platform helps e-commerce stores convert more customers by simplifying the creation and maintenance of fast, customizable stores.","title":"How to use apps to add functionality to your sites.","content":"In this latest release, deco is revolutionizing the way you add functionality to your **sites**.

Por outro lado, com o grande aumento do número de consumidores online, nunca houve maior oportunidade pra crescer. Neste contexto, **oferecer experiências distintas é crucial.**\n\nContudo, mesmo as maiores marcas tem dificuldade construir algo além do previsível - páginas lentas e estáticas para todos os usuários. O resultado todos já sabem: **baixa conversão** -- pessoas deixam de comprar na loja porque não viram um conteúdo que lhe agrada ou porquê as páginas demoraram pra carregar em seus celulares.\n\nVamos entender primeiro porque isso acontece.\n\n\n## Por quê seu site performa mal?\n\n### 1. Sua loja demora para construir\n\nO time de tecnologia para ecommerce é pouco produtivo pois trabalha com frameworks e tech stacks complexas de aprender e fazer manutenção - e que vão ficando ainda mais complexas com o tempo, além do talento em tech ser escasso.\n\nPessoas desenvolvedoras gastam horas e horas cada mês com a complexidade acidental das tecnologias usadas: esperando o tempo de deploy, cuidando de milhares de linhas de código, ou lidando com dependências no npm - sobra pouco tempo para codar de verdade.\n\nResultado: o custo de novas funcionalidades é caro e a entrega é demorada, além de ser operacionalmente complexo contratar e treinar devs.\n\n\n### 2. Sua loja demora para carregar\n\nSabe-se que a velocidade de carregamento de uma página afeta drastricamente a taxa de conversão e o SEO. Em um site \"médio\", é esperado que cada 100ms a menos no tempo de carregamento de uma página, aumente em 1% a conversão.\n\nAinda assim, a maior parte das lojas tem storefronts (frentes de loja de ecommerce) com nota abaixo de 50 no [Google Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/). E poucos parecem saber resolver.\n\nCom isso, o ecommerce global perde trilhões (!) de dólares em vendas.\n\nParte do problema é a escolha do framework e das tecnologias envolvidas:\n\n- a.  SPA (Single Page Application) não é a tecnologia ideal para ecommerce, especialmente para performance e SEO.\n\n- b.  A complexidade de criar código com esse paradigma cria bases de código difíceis de manter e adicionar novas funcionalidades.\n\n\n### 3. Sua loja demora para evoluir\n\nNos negócios e na vida, a evolução contínua e o aprendizado diário é o que gera sucesso. Especialmente no varejo, que vive de otimização contínua de margem.\n\nContudo, times de ecommerce dependem de devs para editar, testar, aprender e evoluir suas lojas.\n\nDevs, por sua vez, estão geralmente sobrecarregadas de demandas, e demoram demais para entregar o que foi pedido, ainda que sejam tasks simples.\n\nPara piorar, as ferramentas necessárias para realizar o ciclo completo de CRO (conversion rate optimization) como teste A/B, analytics, personalização e content management system (CMS) estão fragmentadas, o que exige ter que lidar com várias integrações e diversos serviços terceirizados diferentes.\n\nTudo isso aumenta drasticamente a complexidade operacional, especialmente em storefronts de alta escala, onde o ciclo de evolução é lento e ineficaz.\n\n\n## Nossa solução\n\nNosso time ficou mais de 10 anos lidando com estes mesmo problemas. Sabemos que existem tecnologias para criar sites e lojas de alto desempenho, mas a maioria parece não ter a coragem de utilizá-las.\n\nFoi quando decidimos criar a deco.cx.\n\nPara habilitarmos a criação de experiências de alto desempenho foi necessário um novo paradigma, que simplifique a criação de lojas rápidas, sem sacrificar a capacidade de **personalização e de evolução contínua.**\n\nCriamos uma plataforma headless que integra tudo o que uma marca ou agência precisa para gerenciar e otimizar sua experiência digital, tornando fácil tomar decisões em cima de dados reais, e aumentando continuamente as taxas de conversão.\n\n## Como fazemos isso:\n\n### 1. Com deco.cx fica rápido de construir\n\nAceleramos desenvolvimento de lojas, apostando em uma combinação de tecnologias de ponta que oferecem uma experiência de desenvolvimento frontend otimizada e eficiente. A stack inclui:\n\n- [**Deno**](https://deno.land)\n Um runtime seguro para JavaScript e TypeScript, criado para resolver problemas do Node.js, como gerenciamento de dependências e configurações TypeScript.\n\n- [**Fresh**](https://fresh.deno.dev)\nUm framework web minimalista e rápido, que proporciona uma experiência de desenvolvimento mais dinâmica e eficiente, com tempos de compilação rápidos ou inexistentes.\n\n- [**Twind**](https://twind.dev)\nUma biblioteca de CSS-in-JS que permite a criação de estilos dinâmicos, sem sacrificar o desempenho, e oferece compatibilidade com o popular framework Tailwind CSS.\n\n- [**Preact**](https://deno.land)\nUma alternativa leve ao React, que oferece desempenho superior e menor tamanho de pacote para aplicações web modernas.\n\nEssa combinação de tecnologias permite que a deco.cx ofereça uma plataforma de desenvolvimento frontend que melhora a produtividade e reduz o tempo de implementação, além de proporcionar sites de alto desempenho.\n\nOs principais ganhos de produtividade da plataforma e tecnologia deco são:\n\n-   O deploy (e rollback) instantâneo na edge oferecido pelo [deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy)\n\n-   A bibliotecas de componentes universais e extensíveis ([Sections](https://www.deco.cx/docs/en/concepts/section)), além de funções pré-construídas e totalmente customizáveis ([Loaders](https://www.deco.cx/docs/en/concepts/loader)).\n\n-   A facilidade de aprendizado. Qualquer desenvolvedor junior que sabe codar em React, Javascript, HTML e CSS consegue aprender rapidamente a nossa stack, que foi desenhada pensando na melhor experiência de desenvolvimento.\n\n\n### 2. Com deco.cx fica ultrarrápido de navegar\n\nAs tecnologias escolhidas pela deco também facilitam drasticamente a criação de lojas ultrarrápidas.\n\nNormalmente os storesfronts são criados com React e Next.Js - frameworks JavaScript que usam a abordagem de Single-Page Applications (SPA) para construir aplicativos web. Ou seja, o site é carregado em uma única página e o conteúdo é transportado dinamicamente com JavaScript.\n\nDeno e Fresh, tecnologias que usamos aqui, são frameworks de JavaScript que trabalham com outro paradigma: o server-side-rendering, ou seja, o processamento dos componentes da página é feito em servidores antes de ser enviado para o navegador, ao invés de ser processado apenas no lado do cliente.\n\nIsso significa que a página já vem pronta para ser exibida quando é carregada no navegador, o que resulta em um carregamento mais rápido e uma melhor experiência do usuário.\n\nAlém disso, essas tecnologias trabalham nativamente com computação na edge, o que significa que a maior parte da lógica é executada em servidores perto do usuário, reduzindo a latência e melhorando a velocidade de resposta.  Como o processamento é feito em servidores na edge, ele é capaz de realizar tarefas mais pesadas, como buscar e processar dados de fontes externas, de forma mais eficiente.\n\nAo usar essas ferramentas em conjunto, é possível construir e-commerces de alto desempenho, com tempos de carregamento de página mais rápidos e uma experiência geral melhorada.\n\n\n### 3. Com deco.cx fica fácil de evoluir\n\nA plataforma deco oferece, em um mesmo produto, tudo o que as agências e marcas precisam para rodar o ciclo completo de evolução da loja:\n\n- **Library**: Onde os desenvolvedores criam (ou customizam) [loaders](https://www.deco.cx/docs/en/concepts/loader) que puxam dados de qualquer API externa, e usam os dados coletados para criar componentes de interface totalmente editáveis pelos usuários de negócio ([Sections](https://www.deco.cx/docs/en/concepts/section)).\n\n- **Pages**: Nosso CMS integrado, para que o time de negócio consiga [compor e editar experiências rapidamente](https://www.deco.cx/docs/en/concepts/page), usando as funções e componentes de alto desempenho pré-construidos pelos seus desenvolvedores, sem precisar de uma linha de código.\n\n- **Campanhas**: Nossa ferramenta de personalização que te permite agendar ou customizar a mudança que quiser por data ou audiência.

E nós temos a chance de aproveitar essa janela de oportunidade para nos destacarmos no mercado global.\n\nDeno, junto com tecnologias como Fresh e Tailwind, representam a esperança de uma nova direção. Essas tecnologias nos mostraram como é possível ser simples e eficiente. Estamos vendo nascer o próximo Node.js, diante de nossos olhos — e estamos convidados a participar e a co-criá-lo!\n\nPor outro lado, a demanda global por digitalização só acelera.

E nós temos muita oferta de talento brasileiro — jovens pessoas desenvolvedoras, muitas vezes com dificuldade de se colocar no mercado de trabalho apesar de seu grande potencial.\n\nNós temos a oportunidade de atender essa demanda, mostrando o incrível potencial dos desenvolvedores brasileiros. Não precisamos apenas seguir as tendências; podemos liderar e nos tornar referência mundial na criação de experiências digitais de alta performance.\n\nMas a nossa responsabilidade não termina com o domínio dessas tecnologias. Para promover uma mudança estrutural, não basta garantirmos o nosso próprio sucesso. Devemos nos esforçar para sermos mentores, treinarmos a próxima geração e multiplicarmos a tecnologia no Brasil, promovendo a inclusão e dando oportunidades a todos aqueles que desejam ingressar nesse mercado em constante crescimento: especialmente aqueles que previsivelmente não teriam acesso a elas.\n\nEntão, enquanto vocês participam desta Hackathon, lembrem-se do potencial que têm em mãos e da responsabilidade compartilhada. Que vocês aproveitem ao máximo essa oportunidade, tanto para o seu crescimento pessoal quanto para o desenvolvimento da nossa comunidade.

Mas acreditem, esse prêmio não é o melhor que vocês vão levar daqui — longe disso.\n\nA verdadeira recompensa é a oportunidade de adquirir novas habilidades que os diferenciam e os elevam a outro patamar como desenvolvedores e desenvolvedoras. E ainda maior que isso: a oportunidade de protagonizar a próxima geração de desenvolvimento web global.\n\nO estado atual de complexidade acumulada no desenvolvimento web é insustentável. Os anos de desenvolvimento na \"câmara de eco\" dos frameworks JS gerou uma enorme fricção, uma grande barreira de entrada para desenvolver web apps.\n\nCada vez é necessário aprender mais frameworks, padrões e bibliotecas para ser minimamente produtivo. O tempo de build de sites baseados nessas stacks limitam nossa criatividade no dia a dia. Além disso, temos grandes dificuldades de entregar sites performáticos. Não precisa ser assim!\n\nVivemos em um momento único na história do desenvolvimento web. Deno está no início de uma revolução que transformará a maneira como criamos e entregamos experiências digitais. E nós temos a chance de aproveitar essa janela de oportunidade para nos destacarmos no mercado global.\n\nDeno, junto com tecnologias como Fresh e Tailwind, representam a esperança de uma nova direção. Essas tecnologias nos mostraram como é possível ser simples e eficiente. Estamos vendo nascer o próximo Node.js, diante de nossos olhos — e estamos convidados a participar e a co-criá-lo!\n\nPor outro lado, a demanda global por digitalização só acelera. Demanda por projetos, demanda por sites, demanda por pessoas desenvolvedoras. E nós temos muita oferta de talento brasileiro — jovens pessoas desenvolvedoras, muitas vezes com dificuldade de se colocar no mercado de trabalho apesar de seu grande potencial.\n\nNós temos a oportunidade de atender essa demanda, mostrando o incrível potencial dos desenvolvedores brasileiros. Não precisamos apenas seguir as tendências; podemos liderar e nos tornar referência mundial na criação de experiências digitais de alta performance.\n\nMas a nossa responsabilidade não termina com o domínio dessas tecnologias. Para promover uma mudança estrutural, não basta garantirmos o nosso próprio sucesso. Devemos nos esforçar para sermos mentores, treinarmos a próxima geração e multiplicarmos a tecnologia no Brasil, promovendo a inclusão e dando oportunidades a todos aqueles que desejam ingressar nesse mercado em constante crescimento: especialmente aqueles que previsivelmente não teriam acesso a elas.\n\nEntão, enquanto vocês participam desta Hackathon, lembrem-se do potencial que têm em mãos e da responsabilidade compartilhada. Que vocês aproveitem ao máximo essa oportunidade, tanto para o seu crescimento pessoal quanto para o desenvolvimento da nossa comunidade. Estamos construindo algo muito maior do que cada um de nós.\n\nDesejo a todos vocês um ótimo evento, repleto de aprendizado, colaboração e inovação. Que comecem os trabalhos!"}},"date":"03/12/2023","path":"abertura-ii-hackathon-deco.md","author":"Guilherme Rodrigues"},{"img":"https://ozksgdmyrqcxcwhnbepg.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/assets/530/179d2e1f-8214-46f4-bc85-497f2313145e","body":{"en":{"descr":"Recriando a página da deno-land utilizando a plataforma da deco.cx com as tecnologias: Deno, Fresh, Preact e Twind.","title":"Minha experiência com deco.cx","content":"## Desafio\n\nRecentemente aceitei um desafio e quero compartilhar como foi a minha experiência.\n\nO desafio era reconstruir a Home da [https://deno.land/](https://deno.land/) utilizando a plataforma deco.cx como CMS.\n\n## O que é deco.cx?\n\nÉ uma plataforma criada por um time de pessoas que trabalharam na Vtex, para construir páginas e lojas virtuais performáticas e em um curto período de tempo.\n\nCom o slogan \"Crie, teste e evolua sua loja.

Quando era criança, costumava me perguntar sobre isso. A vida realmente é curta ou estamos realmente nos queixando de sua finitude? Seríamos tão propensos a sentir que a vida é curta se vivêssemos 10 vezes mais tempo?\n\nComo não parecia haver maneira de responder a essa pergunta, parei de me perguntar sobre isso. Depois tive filhos. Isso me deu uma maneira de responder à pergunta e a resposta é que a vida realmente é curta.\n\nTer filhos me mostrou como converter uma quantidade contínua, o tempo, em quantidades discretas. Você só tem 52 fins de semana com seu filho de 2 anos. Se o Natal-como-mágica dure, digamos, dos 3 aos 10 anos, só poderá ver seu filho experimentá-lo 8 vezes. E enquanto é impossível dizer o que é muito ou pouco de uma quantidade contínua como o tempo, 8 não é muito de alguma coisa. Se você tivesse uma punhado de 8 amendoins ou uma prateleira de 8 livros para escolher, a quantidade definitivamente pareceria limitada, independentemente da sua expectativa de vida.\n\nOk, então a vida realmente é curta. Isso faz alguma diferença saber disso?\n\nFez para mim. Isso significa que argumentos do tipo \"A vida é muito curta para x\" têm muita força. Não é apenas uma figura de linguagem dizer que a vida é muito curta para alguma coisa. Não é apenas um sinônimo de chato. Se você achar que a vida é muito curta para alguma coisa, deve tentar eliminá-la se puder.\n\nQuando me pergunto o que descobri que a vida é muito curta, a palavra que me vem à cabeça é \"besteira\". Eu percebo que essa resposta é um pouco tautológica. Quase é a definição de besteira que é a coisa de que a vida é muito curta. E ainda assim a besteira tem um caráter distintivo. Há algo falso nela. É o alimento junk da experiência. [1]\n\nSe você perguntar a si mesmo o que gasta o seu tempo em besteira, provavelmente já sabe a resposta. Reuniões desnecessárias, disputas sem sentido, burocracia, postura, lidar com os erros de outras pessoas, engarrafamentos, passatempos viciantes mas pouco gratificantes.\n\nHá duas maneiras pelas quais esse tipo de coisa entra em sua vida: ou é imposto a você ou o engana. Até certo ponto, você tem que suportar as besteiras impostas por circunstâncias. Você precisa ganhar dinheiro e ganhar dinheiro consiste principalmente em realizar tarefas. De fato, a lei da oferta e da demanda garante isso: quanto mais gratificante é algum tipo de trabalho, mais barato as pessoas o farão. Pode ser que menos tarefas sejam impostas a você do que você pensa, no entanto. Sempre houve uma corrente de pessoas que optam por sair da rotina padrão e vão viver em algum lugar onde as oportunidades são menores no sentido convencional, mas a vida parece mais autêntica. Isso pode se tornar mais comum.\n\nVocê pode reduzir a quantidade de besteira em sua vida sem precisar se mudar. A quantidade de tempo que você precisa gastar com besteiras varia entre empregadores. A maioria das grandes organizações (e muitas pequenas) está imersa nelas. Mas se você priorizar conscientemente a redução de besteiras acima de outros fatores, como dinheiro e prestígio, pode encontrar empregadores que irão desperdiçar menos do seu tempo.\n\nSe você é freelancer ou uma pequena empresa, pode fazer isso no nível de clientes individuais. Se você demitir ou evitar clientes tóxicos, pode diminuir a quantidade de besteira em sua vida mais do que diminui sua renda.\n\nMas, enquanto alguma quantidade de besteira é inevitavelmente imposta a você, a besteira que se infiltra em sua vida enganando-o não é culpa de ninguém, mas sua própria. E ainda assim, a besteira que você escolhe pode ser mais difícil de eliminar do que a besteira que é imposta a você. Coisas que o atraem para desperdiçar seu tempo precisam ser muito boas em enganá-lo. Um exemplo que será familiar para muitas pessoas é discutir online. Quando alguém contradiz você, está, de certa forma, atacando você. Às vezes bastante abertamente. Seu instinto quando é atacado é se defender. Mas, assim como muitos instintos, esse não foi projetado para o mundo em que vivemos agora. Contrariamente ao que parece, é melhor, na maioria das vezes, não se defender. Caso contrário, essas pessoas estão literalmente tomando sua vida. [2]\n\nDiscutir online é apenas incidentalmente viciante. Há coisas mais perigosas do que isso. Como já escrevi antes, um subproduto do progresso técnico é que as coisas que gostamos tendem a se tornar mais viciantes. Isso significa que precisaremos fazer um esforço consciente para evitar vícios, para nos colocarmos fora de nós mesmos e perguntarmos: \"é assim que quero estar gastando meu tempo?\"\n\nAlém de evitar besteiras, devemos procurar ativamente coisas que importam. Mas coisas diferentes importam para pessoas diferentes e a maioria precisa aprender o que importa para elas. Alguns são afortunados e percebem cedo que adoram matemática, cuidar de animais ou escrever e, então, descobrem uma maneira de passar muito tempo fazendo isso. Mas a maioria das pessoas começa com uma vida que é uma mistura de coisas que importam e coisas que não importam e só gradualmente aprende a distinguir entre elas.\n\nPara os jovens, especialmente, muita dessa confusão é induzida pelas situações artificiais em que se encontram. Na escola intermediária e na escola secundária, o que os outros estudantes acham de você parece ser a coisa mais importante do mundo. Mas quando você pergunta aos adultos o que eles fizeram de errado nessa idade, quase todos dizem que se importavam demais com o que os outros estudantes achavam deles.\n\nUma heurística para distinguir coisas que importam é perguntar a si mesmo se você se importará com elas no futuro. A coisa falsa que importa geralmente tem um pico afiado de parecer importar. É assim que o engana. A área sob a curva é pequena, mas sua forma se crava em sua consciência como uma alfinete.\n\nAs coisas que importam nem sempre são aquelas que as pessoas chamariam de \"importantes\". Tomar café com um amigo importa. Você não vai sentir depois que isso foi um desperdício de tempo.\n\nUma coisa ótima em ter crianças pequenas é que elas fazem você gastar tempo em coisas que importam: elas. Elas puxam sua manga enquanto você está olhando para o seu celular e dizem: \"você vai brincar comigo?\". E as chances são de que essa seja, de fato, a opção de minimização de besteira.\n\nSe a vida é curta, devemos esperar que sua brevidade nos surpreenda. E é exatamente isso que costuma acontecer. Você assume as coisas como garantidas e, então, elas desaparecem. Você acha que sempre pode escrever aquele livro, ou subir aquela montanha, ou o que quer que seja, e então percebe que a janela se fechou. As janelas mais tristes fecham quando outras pessoas morrem. Suas vidas também são curtas. Depois que minha mãe morreu, eu desejei ter passado mais tempo com ela. Eu vivi como se ela sempre estivesse lá. E, de maneira típica e discreta, ela incentivou essa ilusão. Mas era uma ilusão. Acho que muitas pessoas cometem o mesmo erro que eu cometi.\n\nA maneira usual de evitar ser surpreendido por algo é estar consciente disso. Quando a vida era mais precária, as pessoas costumavam ser conscientes da morte em um grau que agora pareceria um pouco morboso. Não tenho certeza do porquê, mas não parece ser a resposta certa lembrar constantemente da caveira pairando no ombro de todos. Talvez uma solução melhor seja olhar o problema pelo outro lado. Cultive o hábito de ser impaciente com as coisas que mais quer fazer. Não espere antes de subir aquela montanha ou escrever aquele livro ou visitar sua mãe. Você não precisa se lembrar constantemente por que não deve esperar. Apenas não espere.\n\nPosso pensar em mais duas coisas que alguém faz quando não tem muito de algo: tentar obter mais disso e saborear o que tem. Ambos fazem sentido aqui.\n\nComo você vive afeta por quanto tempo você vive. A maioria das pessoas poderia fazer melhor. Eu entre elas.\n\nMas você provavelmente pode obter ainda mais efeito prestando mais atenção ao tempo que tem. É fácil deixar os dias passarem voando. O \"fluxo\" que as pessoas imaginativas adoram tanto tem um parente mais sombrio que impede você de pausar para saborear a vida no meio da rotina diária de tarefas e alarmes. Uma das coisas mais impressionantes que já li não estava em um livro, mas no título de um: Burning the Days (Queimando os Dias), de James Salter.\n\nÉ possível diminuir um pouco o tempo. Eu melhorei nisso. As crianças ajudam. Quando você tem crianças pequenas, há muitos momentos tão perfeitos que você não consegue deixar de notar.\n\nTambém ajuda sentir que você tirou tudo de alguma experiência. O motivo pelo qual estou triste por minha mãe não é apenas porque sinto falta dela, mas porque penso em tudo o que poderíamos ter feito e não fizemos. Meu filho mais velho vai fazer 7 anos em breve. E, embora sinta falta da versão dele de 3 anos, pelo menos não tenho nenhum arrependimento pelo que poderia ter sido. Tivemos o melhor tempo que um pai e um filho de 3 anos poderiam ter.\n\nCorte implacavelmente as besteiras, não espere para fazer coisas que importam e saboreie o tempo que tem. É isso o que você faz quando a vida é curta.  \n\n---\n\nNotas\n\n[1] No começo, eu não gostei que a palavra que me veio à mente tivesse outros significados. Mas então percebi que os outros significados estão bastante relacionados. Besteira no sentido de coisas em que você desperdiça seu tempo é bastante parecida com besteira intelectual.\n\n[2] Escolhi esse exemplo de forma deliberada como uma nota para mim mesmo. Eu sou atacado muito online. As pessoas contam as mentiras mais loucas sobre mim. E até agora eu fiz um trabalho bastante medíocre de suprimir a inclinação natural do ser humano de dizer \"Ei, isso não é verdade!\".\n\nObrigado a Jessica Livingston e Geoff Ralston por ler rascunhos deste."},"pt":{"descr":"Por Paul Graham, traduzido por ChatGPT.","title":"A vida é curta","content":"A vida é curta, como todos sabem.

Coisas que o atraem para desperdiçar seu tempo precisam ser muito boas em enganá-lo. Um exemplo que será familiar para muitas pessoas é discutir online. Quando alguém contradiz você, está, de certa forma, atacando você. Às vezes bastante abertamente. Seu instinto quando é atacado é se defender. Mas, assim como muitos instintos, esse não foi projetado para o mundo em que vivemos agora. Contrariamente ao que parece, é melhor, na maioria das vezes, não se defender. Caso contrário, essas pessoas estão literalmente tomando sua vida. [2]\n\nDiscutir online é apenas incidentalmente viciante. Há coisas mais perigosas do que isso. Como já escrevi antes, um subproduto do progresso técnico é que as coisas que gostamos tendem a se tornar mais viciantes. Isso significa que precisaremos fazer um esforço consciente para evitar vícios, para nos colocarmos fora de nós mesmos e perguntarmos: \"é assim que quero estar gastando meu tempo?\"\n\nAlém de evitar besteiras, devemos procurar ativamente coisas que importam. Mas coisas diferentes importam para pessoas diferentes e a maioria precisa aprender o que importa para elas. Alguns são afortunados e percebem cedo que adoram matemática, cuidar de animais ou escrever e, então, descobrem uma maneira de passar muito tempo fazendo isso. Mas a maioria das pessoas começa com uma vida que é uma mistura de coisas que importam e coisas que não importam e só gradualmente aprende a distinguir entre elas.\n\nPara os jovens, especialmente, muita dessa confusão é induzida pelas situações artificiais em que se encontram. Na escola intermediária e na escola secundária, o que os outros estudantes acham de você parece ser a coisa mais importante do mundo. Mas quando você pergunta aos adultos o que eles fizeram de errado nessa idade, quase todos dizem que se importavam demais com o que os outros estudantes achavam deles.\n\nUma heurística para distinguir coisas que importam é perguntar a si mesmo se você se importará com elas no futuro. A coisa falsa que importa geralmente tem um pico afiado de parecer importar. É assim que o engana. A área sob a curva é pequena, mas sua forma se crava em sua consciência como uma alfinete.\n\nAs coisas que importam nem sempre são aquelas que as pessoas chamariam de \"importantes\". Tomar café com um amigo importa. Você não vai sentir depois que isso foi um desperdício de tempo.\n\nUma coisa ótima em ter crianças pequenas é que elas fazem você gastar tempo em coisas que importam: elas. Elas puxam sua manga enquanto você está olhando para o seu celular e dizem: \"você vai brincar comigo?\". E as chances são de que essa seja, de fato, a opção de minimização de besteira.\n\nSe a vida é curta, devemos esperar que sua brevidade nos surpreenda. E é exatamente isso que costuma acontecer. Você assume as coisas como garantidas e, então, elas desaparecem. Você acha que sempre pode escrever aquele livro, ou subir aquela montanha, ou o que quer que seja, e então percebe que a janela se fechou. As janelas mais tristes fecham quando outras pessoas morrem. Suas vidas também são curtas. Depois que minha mãe morreu, eu desejei ter passado mais tempo com ela. Eu vivi como se ela sempre estivesse lá. E, de maneira típica e discreta, ela incentivou essa ilusão. Mas era uma ilusão. Acho que muitas pessoas cometem o mesmo erro que eu cometi.\n\nA maneira usual de evitar ser surpreendido por algo é estar consciente disso. Quando a vida era mais precária, as pessoas costumavam ser conscientes da morte em um grau que agora pareceria um pouco morboso. Não tenho certeza do porquê, mas não parece ser a resposta certa lembrar constantemente da caveira pairando no ombro de todos. Talvez uma solução melhor seja olhar o problema pelo outro lado. Cultive o hábito de ser impaciente com as coisas que mais quer fazer. Não espere antes de subir aquela montanha ou escrever aquele livro ou visitar sua mãe. Você não precisa se lembrar constantemente por que não deve esperar. Apenas não espere.\n\nPosso pensar em mais duas coisas que alguém faz quando não tem muito de algo: tentar obter mais disso e saborear o que tem. Ambos fazem sentido aqui.\n\nComo você vive afeta por quanto tempo você vive. A maioria das pessoas poderia fazer melhor. Eu entre elas.\n\nMas você provavelmente pode obter ainda mais efeito prestando mais atenção ao tempo que tem. É fácil deixar os dias passarem voando. O \"fluxo\" que as pessoas imaginativas adoram tanto tem um parente mais sombrio que impede você de pausar para saborear a vida no meio da rotina diária de tarefas e alarmes. Uma das coisas mais impressionantes que já li não estava em um livro, mas no título de um: Burning the Days (Queimando os Dias), de James Salter.\n\nÉ possível diminuir um pouco o tempo. Eu melhorei nisso. As crianças ajudam. Quando você tem crianças pequenas, há muitos momentos tão perfeitos que você não consegue deixar de notar.\n\nTambém ajuda sentir que você tirou tudo de alguma experiência. O motivo pelo qual estou triste por minha mãe não é apenas porque sinto falta dela, mas porque penso em tudo o que poderíamos ter feito e não fizemos. Meu filho mais velho vai fazer 7 anos em breve. E, embora sinta falta da versão dele de 3 anos, pelo menos não tenho nenhum arrependimento pelo que poderia ter sido. Tivemos o melhor tempo que um pai e um filho de 3 anos poderiam ter.\n\nCorte implacavelmente as besteiras, não espere para fazer coisas que importam e saboreie o tempo que tem. É isso o que você faz quando a vida é curta.  \n\n---\n\nNotas\n\n[1] No começo, eu não gostei que a palavra que me veio à mente tivesse outros significados. Mas então percebi que os outros significados estão bastante relacionados. Besteira no sentido de coisas em que você desperdiça seu tempo é bastante parecida com besteira intelectual.\n\n[2] Escolhi esse exemplo de forma deliberada como uma nota para mim mesmo. Eu sou atacado muito online. As pessoas contam as mentiras mais loucas sobre mim. E até agora eu fiz um trabalho bastante medíocre de suprimir a inclinação natural do ser humano de dizer \"Ei, isso não é verdade!\".\n\nObrigado a Jessica Livingston e Geoff Ralston por ler rascunhos deste."}},"date":"11/29/2022","path":"pg-vb-pt-br.md","author":"Chat GPT"}]},"__resolveType":"site/loaders/blogPostLoader.ts"}
