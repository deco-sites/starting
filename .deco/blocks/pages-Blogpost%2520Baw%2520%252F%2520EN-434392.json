As a digitally native vertical brand known for its dynamic and fast-paced release cycles, Baw struggled to maintain its distinctive brand identity while meeting the increasing expectations of a discerning customer base. The brand’s existing infrastructure fell short in providing a quick navigation and easy site customization, and was not equipped to handle the rapid content turnover required by Baw's marketing strategies. These inefficiencies hindered conversion rates and sales.</p>",
