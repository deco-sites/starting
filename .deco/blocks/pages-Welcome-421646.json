But twenty years later, web development, and specially frontend, became extremely complicated. We’re here to make it simple again. This is how we are doing it:</p><p class=\"mb-4\">We blur the lines between 'frontend' and 'backend' development. Soon, every web developer will be an “edge” developer. They will build low-latency, lightweight sites that compose data from multiple sources, respond dynamically to each audience and even run full-blown integration workflows on the back-office — all in the same tool, powered by a huge ecosystem of apps.</p><p class=\"mb-4\">We unlock effective collaboration between web developers and their business teams. In one click, content creators get a high-performance site with a powerful real-time visual editor,&nbsp;on-brand component library, built-in analytics, campaign management and much more. We combine the full customization of code with the business autonomy of no-code — in one platform.</p><p class=\"mb-4\">We narrow the gap between idea and execution, allowing smaller teams to iterate and learn faster from their real-world users. With complete release management, instant rollbacks, A/B testing, feature-flags and observability, we tighten the feedback loop of evolution so our users ship often and ship fearlessly.</p><p class=\"mb-4\">We are the platform of choice to start making money with web development. By making high-quality sites easier to build, and high-integrity developers easier to find in our developer community, we enable a new generation of makers to create high-performance web-based businesses and thrive on the internet. </p><p class=\"mb-4\">We build the future of webdev: the zero-friction webdev platform.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Welcome to deco.cx! <span class=\"play-sound underline\" style=\"cursor: progress; text-decoration-style: solid;\">It's Time To Kick Ass And Get Site Done. </span></p>\n<audio id=\"audioPlayer\" src=\"https://dl.sndup.net/xjkv/Its%20time%20to%20kick%20ass%20and%20chew%20bubblegum.webm\"></audio>\n<script>\n    document.querySelector('.play-sound').addEventListener('mouseenter', function() {\n        var audio = document.getElementById('audioPlayer');\n        audio.play(); // Plays the audio\n    });\n\n    // Optionally, stop the sound when not hovering\n    document.querySelector('.play-sound').addEventListener('mouseleave', function() {\n        var audio = document.getElementById('audioPlayer');\n        audio.pause(); // Pauses the audio\n        audio.currentTime = 0; // Resets the audio to the start\n    });\n</script>"
