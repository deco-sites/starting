The company grappled with a stagnant Return on Ad Spend (ROAS), low conversion rates, poor website performance, and a high cart abandonment rate, largely attributed to the complex process involved in purchasing controlled medications.<strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-c58de6b9-7fff-641b-2a62-46c9f72502a1\"></strong><!-- notionvc: fd713655-e1d4-47cf-9800-d0401b099927 --></p>","label":"Challenge","textColor":"#ffffff","titleLevel":"H1","__resolveType":"site/sections/Case/ArticleParagraph.tsx"},{"text":"<p dir=\"ltr\">Faced with these pains, the company sought help from <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" data-mce-style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a data-mce-href=\"https://agencian1.com.br/\" href=\"https://agencian1.com.br/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">N1</a></span>, an ecommerce specialist and esteemed partner of VTEX and deco.cx. N1 drew up a strategy which involved porting the site's storefront to deco.cx and using VTEX as the backend platform, in a headless architecture. By using deco.cx as the frontend provider, N1 would be able to implement the site quickly, improve its performance, and guarantee its ability to easily apply any brand-related or paid media strategies.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">N1 rebuilt the whole site (including a new design) in only three months. It also partnered with healthcare specialists to test the usability of the online store, and together with Hospitalar decided on a series of improvements to smoothen the customer experience. After identifying that the high rates of cart abandonment were strongly correlated with the friction over buying prescription medication, they implemented several changes. Key interventions included:</p><ol><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Product identification: clear marking of products requiring special documentation throughout the shopping journey to align customer expectations from the start.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Informative banners and landing pages: utilizing deco.cx's no-code page builder for educating customers on controlled medication purchases.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Fast loading content: leveraged deco.cx's infrastructure and real-time performance monitoring tools for a seamless buying experience.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p dir=\"ltr\">Under N1's guidance and support, Hospitalar also revamped its digital marketing strategies.
