Customizations outside the platform's capabilities led to operational complexities and hindered site performance. The 2021 Black Friday campaign was a wake-up call. With page load times exceeding 10 seconds, frustrated customers couldn't complete purchases, leading to significant revenue loss.</p>",

At the time, we knew that our site wouldn’t reach deco.cx’s gold standard of 90+ pagespeed, and we didn’t aim for that either: if we could reduce our site’s loading time by half that would be huge already. Beyond that though, I realized that the operational gains were so substantial that it was worth migrating to deco.cx’s stack even with an incomplete product.”",
