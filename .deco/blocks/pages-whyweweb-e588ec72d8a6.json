        "            We built the web with audacious ambitions: to wire the world, to             connect every human mind, to accelerate progress. But, as we             advanced, web development got tangled in complexity. What was once             straightforward now feels like navigating a maze of frameworks and             services, making it harder for new voices and ideas to emerge.",
        "The need to simplify is urgent. Web development shouldn't feel like             a boring puzzle. It should be easy and fun. It should be scalable             and observable by default. It should be realtime and collaborative.             It should give anyone the autonomy to test new ideas and evolve             without fear of \"breaking\". And it should just work.",
        "With AI, TypeScript, modern browsers, fast runtimes, and affordable             edge infrastructure, the web is ready for a breakthrough. This is an             invitation for the contrarians, the doers, the ones eager to make             their mark: it’s time to cut through the clutter, to build the             simpler tools we deserve. It's time to \"get site done.\""
