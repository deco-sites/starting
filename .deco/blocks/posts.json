To help you make the most of this shopping period, we've compiled a list of essential tasks to ensure that your online store is fully prepared for Black Friday 2023.\n\n## Adopt Ahead-of-Time Builds\n\nFresh recently introduced an innovative feature called \"ahead of time builds,\" designed to transform how you create and deliver your website. This approach not only stabilizes your store's JavaScript but also significantly improves server boot times. To fully understand this new approach, you can explore the structured documentation provided by Fresh [here](https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/concepts/ahead-of-time-builds).\n\nAt [Deco.cx](https://deco.cx/), we strongly recommend adopting the ahead-of-time version because it provides scalability to your server, which is essential for handling the demands of events like Black Friday. To migrate to this new version, instruct your developer to perform the update using the following command:\n\n```sh\ndeno run -Ar https://deco.cx/upgrade\n```\n\nAfter> completing the update, make sure that:\n\n1. Your store is functioning correctly, including checking the home, product detail (PDP), and product listing (PLP) pages, as well as verifying the add-to-cart functionality and any other critical flows.\n2. Administrative editing is working smoothly, allowing you to edit your store's sections and publish them.\n\nIf your store is already online, the [Deco.cx](https://deco.cx/) team has already run this command for you. To verify, ask your developer to look for a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub with the title \"Preparations for Black Friday.\" If you encounter any issues during this process, don't hesitate to contact us on [Deco.cx Discord](https://deco.cx/discord).\n\n## Support for Mobile Safari\n\nA few months ago, we shared a blog post detailing the [lessons we've learned](https://www.deco.cx/en/blog/licoes-6-meses.md) from our stores in production. We strongly recommend implementing all the suggestions mentioned in the post before Black Friday. However, one of the most critical steps is to ensure that your store functions seamlessly on Safari versions 12, 13, and 14.\n\nTo achieve this, follow these steps:\n\n1. Verify that your `fresh.config.ts` file includes the Safari12 build target.\n2. Ensure that your website does not use the `<dialog>` tag.\n\nEngage your developer to make the necessary adjustments to remove the `<dialog>` tag and set Safari12 as the build target. We recommend performing this step after migrating to ahead-of-time builds to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nAs we kick off the holiday shopping season, the [Deco.cx](https://deco.cx/) team is dedicated to providing stability and reliability during this critical period. Starting this week, we will be actively working on stability improvements to enhance your experience on Black Friday. It's crucial to stay up-to-date with the latest Deco versions and keep an eye out for more informative posts on how to optimize your online store for success on Black Friday.","readTime":"5","authorAvatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1753396?v=4"},{"img":"https://ozksgdmyrqcxcwhnbepg.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/assets/530/c4f791fe-9f43-400d-94a0-c203a6dc3b37","seo":{"image":"https://github.com/deco-sites/std/assets/18706156/ec92362b-9d18-42d8-9c60-bcb5bfef0d71","title":"deco play is released","description":"Use deco.cx's powerful CMS directly from the command line with Preact, Tailwind and Deno"},"date":"31/10/2023","path":"deco-play.md","descr":"Use deco.cx's powerful CMS directly from the command line","title":"deco play","author":"Héricles Emanuel","content":"## deco play\n\nMaking life easier for developers is at deco's core, and today we're proud to announce deco play, a new way to test our stack in record time!\n\nTo start testing deco play, go to [https://play.deco.cx](https://play.deco.cx) and follow the instructions.\n\n![deco play](https://github.com/deco-sites/std/assets/18706156/ec92362b-9d18-42d8-9c60-bcb5bfef0d71)\n\nIt's the fastest way to spin up a deco site or app on your local machine and start developing with Preact, Tailwind, Deno and getting all the benefits of our CMS that automatically extracts the schema from your functions (UI components, loaders, actions…), makes them easily editable and composable on a Web UI that saves the data locally.\n\nAnd you don't need to be logged into [deco.cx](https://deco.cx) to use deco play, it's just one click away from the command line!","readTime":"2","authorAvatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30700596?v=4"},{"img":"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121065272/278081341-14f42eff-92aa-46aa-b282-c3ce2823fcd5.png","seo":{"image":"https://github.com/deco-cx/apps/assets/882438/1b3f06d2-1d2d-4ec8-a9cf-2c14008229a6","title":"New Analytics Tool","description":"Analytics with realtime, goals and conversions!"},"date":"24/10/2023","path":"analytics.md","descr":"Analytics with realtime, goals and conversions!","title":"New Analytics Tool","author":"Matheus Gaudencio and Nathan Luiz","content":"## Introduction\n\nFollowing up on [Updated Redirects configuration](https://www.deco.cx/en/blog/redirects.md), **we're releasing today the new analytics tool**.

They provide a short-term solution and are ideal for situations\n  where you might want to reroute traffic temporarily.\n\n- **Permanent**: stored by search engines and crawlers. They permanently update\n  the path for the current page, and they are hard to undo. If you're unsure\n  about which type of redirect to choose, we strongly recommend using temporary\n  redirects.\n\n### **Enabling this Feature for Your Site**\n\nFor websites created after the date of this blog post (Oct 23 2023), this\nfeature will be enabled by default.\n\nIf your site was created before this blog post, you can enable this feature by\nupdating your site dependencies to `deco@1.41.11` and `apps@0.15.8`. (Run\n`deno task update`) Next, update your app's **`site`** by adding a new Site Map\nentry named `Redirects`.

Nesse período, aprendemos o que deve ser evitado, o que não funciona e a melhor maneira de iniciar o desenvolvimento de uma loja online. A seguir, compartilhamos um resumo das lições que adquirimos durante essa jornada.\n\n## Início do Desenvolvimento de uma Loja\n\nTodos projetos criados na Deco partem de um template pré-configurado com diversos componentes, integrações e temas. Observamos que, após criar a loja, alguns desenvolvedores recorrem ao GitHub para modificar componentes e temas diretamente no código. Embora isso seja um reflexo natural do trabalho de um desenvolvedor, notamos que os projetos nos quais o desenvolvimento se concentra principalmente no CMS (Content Management System) tendem a ser concluídos mais rapidamente e com melhor desempenho.\n\nO fluxo que descobrimos ser o ideal é o seguinte:\n\n1. Criar o projeto.\n2. Personalizar o tema, componentes, otimização de SEO, entre outros através do admin da deco.\n3. Apresentar o resultado ao cliente final e coletar feedback.\n4. Com base no feedback, ajustar a loja no CMS, usando as seções predefinidas e voltar ao passo 3.\n6. Se o cliente estiver satisfeito, migrar o domínio para a Deco.\n7. Caso seja necessário fazer alterações no código, adicionar seções específicas para o caso de uso em questão.\n\n## A Tag `<dialog>`\n\nEm versões anteriores de nossos templates, utilizávamos a tag HTML5 `<dialog>`. Essa tag permitia a criação de modais com suporte à acessibilidade. No entanto, identificamos dois problemas principais relacionados a ela:\n\n1. Exigia JavaScript para funcionar corretamente, o que ia de encontro à nossa filosofia de minimizar o uso de JavaScript na página.\n2. Versões recentes do iPhone (10, 11 e 12) não oferecem suporte a essa tag, o que nos forçava a inserir \"polyfills\". Essa inserção era síncrona e prejudicava significativamente o desempenho dos sites.\n\nDevido a esses dois pontos mencionados, adotamos uma abordagem alternativa usando a tag `<input type=\"checkbox>`, que é amplamente suportada por todos os navegadores. Essa mudança resolveu ambos os problemas. Migramos nossos templates para essa técnica e observamos um aumento na compatibilidade entre nossos sites e dispositivos móveis.\n\nSe o seu site ainda estiver usando a tag `<dialog>`, recomendamos fazer a migração o mais rápido possível para `<input type=\"checkbox>` para evitar incompatibilidades com iPhones. Para obter mais informações sobre essa abordagem, consulte [este link](https://daisyui.com/components/modal/#method-2-using-a-hidden-checkbox-legacy).\n\n## Unidades absolutas\n\nPercebemos que algumas de nossas lojas apresentavam taxas de conversão abaixo do esperado em determinados dispositivos, especialmente em iPhones e dispositivos Android. Após uma análise mais aprofundada, identificamos que o botão \"Ir para o checkout\" estava sendo ocultado pela barra de endereços dos navegadores Chrome e Safari em alguns desses dispositivos.\n\nEsse problema ocorreu devido ao uso de unidades absolutas, como `vh` (viewport height) e `vw` (viewport width), em vez de unidades relativas. As unidades absolutas fazem referência ao tamanho total da tela do dispositivo, não levando em consideração a área de renderização da janela, o que pode ocultar partes da interface do usuário.\n\nPara evitar esse tipo de problema, é fundamental evitar o uso de unidades absolutas, como `vh` e `vw`. Recomendamos revisar sua loja para garantir que essas unidades não estejam sendo usadas, especialmente no minicart.\n\n## Flexbox e Unidades Percentuais\n\nOutro problema que identificamos em algumas lojas diz respeito ao layout quebrado em versões mais antigas do Safari. Isso ocorre geralmente quando unidades percentuais são usadas em conjunto com flexbox. Um exemplo disso é o seguinte trecho de código:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"flex\">\n   <div class=\"w-full\"/>\n</div>\n```\n\nNesse exemplo, estamos combinando flexbox (classe `flex`) com unidades percentuais (`width: 100%`). Isso pode funcionar em navegadores mais recentes, mas causa problemas em versões mais antigas do Safari, como o iPhone 10, 11 e 12.\n\nPara solucionar esse problema, recomendamos substituir `w-full` por classes relacionadas ao flexbox:\n\n ```html\n<div class=\"flex\">\n   <div class=\"flex-grow\"/>\n</div>\n```\n\nIsso garantirá que o layout funcione corretamente em todos os navegadores.\n\n\nEstamos sempre acompanhando os novos projetos, coletando os apresentados e melhorando o template [Storefront](https://github.com/deco-sites/storefront)."},{"img":"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121065272/278023987-b7ab4ae9-6669-4e38-94b8-268049fa6569.png","date":"06/10/2023","path":"partials.md","descr":"Revolucionando o Desenvolvimento Web","title":"Partials","author":"Marcos Candeia, Tiago Gimenes","content":"[Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/), o framework web utilizado pela Deco, é conhecido por possibilitar a criação de páginas de altíssimo desempenho. Uma das razões pelas quais as páginas criadas na Deco são tão eficientes é devido à arquitetura de ilhas. Essa arquitetura permite que os desenvolvedores removam partes não interativas do pacote final de JavaScript, reduzindo a quantidade total de JavaScript na página e aliviando o navegador para realizar outras tarefas.\n\nNo entanto, uma das limitações dessa arquitetura é que páginas muito complexas, com muita interatividade e, portanto, muitas ilhas, ainda exigem uma grande quantidade de JavaScript. Felizmente, essa limitação agora é coisa do passado, graças à introdução dos Partials.\n\n## Como Funciona?\n\nOs Partials, inspirados no [htmx](https://htmx.org/docs/), operam com um runtime que intercepta as interações do usuário com elementos de botão, âncora e formulário. Essas interações são enviadas para nosso servidor, que calcula o novo estado da página e responde ao navegador. O navegador recebe o novo estado da IU em HTML puro, que é então processado e as diferenças são aplicadas, alterando a página para o seu estado final. Para obter informações mais detalhadas sobre os Partials, consulte a [documentação](https://github.com/denoland/fresh/issues/1609) do Fresh.\n\n## Partials em Ação\n\nEstamos migrando os componentes da loja da Deco para a nova solução de Partials. Até o momento, migramos o seletor de SKU, que pode ser visualizado em ação [aqui](http://storefront-vtex.deco.site/camisa-masculina-xadrez-sun-e-azul/p?skuId=120). Mais mudanças, como `infinite scroll` e melhorias nos filtros, estão por vir.\n\nOutra funcionalidade desbloqueada é a possibilidade de criar dobras na página. As páginas de comércio eletrônico geralmente são longas e contêm muitos elementos. Os navegadores costumam enfrentar problemas quando há muitos elementos no HTML. Para lidar com isso, foi inventada a técnica de dobra.\n\nA ideia básica dessa técnica é dividir o conteúdo da página em duas partes: o conteúdo acima e o conteúdo abaixo da dobra. O conteúdo acima da dobra é carregado na primeira solicitação ao servidor. O conteúdo abaixo da dobra é carregado assim que a primeira solicitação é concluída. Esse tipo de funcionalidade costumava ser difícil de implementar em arquiteturas mais antigas. Felizmente, embutimos essa lógica em uma nova seção chamada `Deferred`. Esta seção aceita uma lista de seções como parâmetro que devem ter seu carregamento adiado para um momento posterior.\n\nPara usar essa nova seção:\n\n1.

","title":"Como a deco.cx faz sua loja converter mais","author":"Rafael Crespo","content":"Com dezenas de milhões de e-commerces, o varejo digital nunca enfrentou tanta competição. Por outro lado, com o grande aumento do número de consumidores online, nunca houve maior oportunidade pra crescer. Neste contexto, **oferecer experiências distintas é crucial.**\n\nContudo, mesmo as maiores marcas tem dificuldade construir algo além do previsível - páginas lentas e estáticas para todos os usuários. O resultado todos já sabem: **baixa conversão** -- pessoas deixam de comprar na loja porque não viram um conteúdo que lhe agrada ou porquê as páginas demoraram pra carregar em seus celulares.\n\nVamos entender primeiro porque isso acontece.\n\n\n## Por quê seu site performa mal?\n\n### 1. Sua loja demora para construir\n\nO time de tecnologia para ecommerce é pouco produtivo pois trabalha com frameworks e tech stacks complexas de aprender e fazer manutenção - e que vão ficando ainda mais complexas com o tempo, além do talento em tech ser escasso.\n\nPessoas desenvolvedoras gastam horas e horas cada mês com a complexidade acidental das tecnologias usadas: esperando o tempo de deploy, cuidando de milhares de linhas de código, ou lidando com dependências no npm - sobra pouco tempo para codar de verdade.\n\nResultado: o custo de novas funcionalidades é caro e a entrega é demorada, além de ser operacionalmente complexo contratar e treinar devs.\n\n\n### 2. Sua loja demora para carregar\n\nSabe-se que a velocidade de carregamento de uma página afeta drastricamente a taxa de conversão e o SEO. Em um site \"médio\", é esperado que cada 100ms a menos no tempo de carregamento de uma página, aumente em 1% a conversão.\n\nAinda assim, a maior parte das lojas tem storefronts (frentes de loja de ecommerce) com nota abaixo de 50 no [Google Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/). E poucos parecem saber resolver.\n\nCom isso, o ecommerce global perde trilhões (!) de dólares em vendas.\n\nParte do problema é a escolha do framework e das tecnologias envolvidas:\n\n- a.  SPA (Single Page Application) não é a tecnologia ideal para ecommerce, especialmente para performance e SEO.\n\n- b.  A complexidade de criar código com esse paradigma cria bases de código difíceis de manter e adicionar novas funcionalidades.\n\n\n### 3. Sua loja demora para evoluir\n\nNos negócios e na vida, a evolução contínua e o aprendizado diário é o que gera sucesso. Especialmente no varejo, que vive de otimização contínua de margem.\n\nContudo, times de ecommerce dependem de devs para editar, testar, aprender e evoluir suas lojas.\n\nDevs, por sua vez, estão geralmente sobrecarregadas de demandas, e demoram demais para entregar o que foi pedido, ainda que sejam tasks simples.\n\nPara piorar, as ferramentas necessárias para realizar o ciclo completo de CRO (conversion rate optimization) como teste A/B, analytics, personalização e content management system (CMS) estão fragmentadas, o que exige ter que lidar com várias integrações e diversos serviços terceirizados diferentes.\n\nTudo isso aumenta drasticamente a complexidade operacional, especialmente em storefronts de alta escala, onde o ciclo de evolução é lento e ineficaz.\n\n\n## Nossa solução\n\nNosso time ficou mais de 10 anos lidando com estes mesmo problemas. Sabemos que existem tecnologias para criar sites e lojas de alto desempenho, mas a maioria parece não ter a coragem de utilizá-las.\n\nFoi quando decidimos criar a deco.cx.\n\nPara habilitarmos a criação de experiências de alto desempenho foi necessário um novo paradigma, que simplifique a criação de lojas rápidas, sem sacrificar a capacidade de **personalização e de evolução contínua.**\n\nCriamos uma plataforma headless que integra tudo o que uma marca ou agência precisa para gerenciar e otimizar sua experiência digital, tornando fácil tomar decisões em cima de dados reais, e aumentando continuamente as taxas de conversão.\n\n## Como fazemos isso:\n\n### 1. Com deco.cx fica rápido de construir\n\nAceleramos desenvolvimento de lojas, apostando em uma combinação de tecnologias de ponta que oferecem uma experiência de desenvolvimento frontend otimizada e eficiente. A stack inclui:\n\n- [**Deno**](https://deno.land)\n Um runtime seguro para JavaScript e TypeScript, criado para resolver problemas do Node.js, como gerenciamento de dependências e configurações TypeScript.\n\n- [**Fresh**](https://fresh.deno.dev)\nUm framework web minimalista e rápido, que proporciona uma experiência de desenvolvimento mais dinâmica e eficiente, com tempos de compilação rápidos ou inexistentes.\n\n- [**Twind**](https://twind.dev)\nUma biblioteca de CSS-in-JS que permite a criação de estilos dinâmicos, sem sacrificar o desempenho, e oferece compatibilidade com o popular framework Tailwind CSS.\n\n- [**Preact**](https://deno.land)\nUma alternativa leve ao React, que oferece desempenho superior e menor tamanho de pacote para aplicações web modernas.\n\nEssa combinação de tecnologias permite que a deco.cx ofereça uma plataforma de desenvolvimento frontend que melhora a produtividade e reduz o tempo de implementação, além de proporcionar sites de alto desempenho.\n\nOs principais ganhos de produtividade da plataforma e tecnologia deco são:\n\n-   O deploy (e rollback) instantâneo na edge oferecido pelo [deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy)\n\n-   A bibliotecas de componentes universais e extensíveis ([Sections](https://docs.deco.cx/en/concepts/section)), além de funções pré-construídas e totalmente customizáveis ([Loaders](https://docs.deco.cx/en/concepts/loader)).\n\n-   A facilidade de aprendizado. Qualquer desenvolvedor junior que sabe codar em React, Javascript, HTML e CSS consegue aprender rapidamente a nossa stack, que foi desenhada pensando na melhor experiência de desenvolvimento.\n\n\n### 2. Com deco.cx fica ultrarrápido de navegar\n\nAs tecnologias escolhidas pela deco também facilitam drasticamente a criação de lojas ultrarrápidas.\n\nNormalmente os storesfronts são criados com React e Next.Js - frameworks JavaScript que usam a abordagem de Single-Page Applications (SPA) para construir aplicativos web. Ou seja, o site é carregado em uma única página e o conteúdo é transportado dinamicamente com JavaScript.\n\nDeno e Fresh, tecnologias que usamos aqui, são frameworks de JavaScript que trabalham com outro paradigma: o server-side-rendering, ou seja, o processamento dos componentes da página é feito em servidores antes de ser enviado para o navegador, ao invés de ser processado apenas no lado do cliente.\n\nIsso significa que a página já vem pronta para ser exibida quando é carregada no navegador, o que resulta em um carregamento mais rápido e uma melhor experiência do usuário.\n\nAlém disso, essas tecnologias trabalham nativamente com computação na edge, o que significa que a maior parte da lógica é executada em servidores perto do usuário, reduzindo a latência e melhorando a velocidade de resposta.  Como o processamento é feito em servidores na edge, ele é capaz de realizar tarefas mais pesadas, como buscar e processar dados de fontes externas, de forma mais eficiente.\n\nAo usar essas ferramentas em conjunto, é possível construir e-commerces de alto desempenho, com tempos de carregamento de página mais rápidos e uma experiência geral melhorada.\n\n\n### 3. Com deco.cx fica fácil de evoluir\n\nA plataforma deco oferece, em um mesmo produto, tudo o que as agências e marcas precisam para rodar o ciclo completo de evolução da loja:\n\n- **Library**: Onde os desenvolvedores criam (ou customizam) [loaders](https://docs.deco.cx/en/concepts/loader) que puxam dados de qualquer API externa, e usam os dados coletados para criar componentes de interface totalmente editáveis pelos usuários de negócio ([Sections](https://docs.deco.cx/en/concepts/section)).\n\n- **Pages**: Nosso CMS integrado, para que o time de negócio consiga [compor e editar experiências rapidamente](https://docs.deco.cx/en/concepts/page), usando as funções e componentes de alto desempenho pré-construidos pelos seus desenvolvedores, sem precisar de uma linha de código.\n\n- **Campanhas**: Nossa ferramenta de personalização que te permite agendar ou customizar a mudança que quiser por data ou audiência. Seja uma landing page para a Black Friday ou uma sessão para um público específico, você decide como e quando seu site se comporta para cada usuário.\n\n- **Experimentos**: Testes A/B ou multivariados em 5 segundos - nossa ferramenta te permite acompanhar, em tempo real, a performance dos seus experimentos e relação à versão de controle.\n\n- **Analytics**: Dados em tempo real sobre toda a jornada de compra e a performance da loja. Aqui você cria relatórios personalizados, que consolidam dados de qualquer API externa.\n\n\n## O que está por vir\n\nEstamos só começando. Nossa primeira linha de código na deco foi em Setembro 2022. De lá pra cá montamos [uma comunidade no Discord](https://deco.cx/discord), que já conta com 1.050+ membros, entre agências, estudantes, marcas e experts.\n\nSe você está atrás de uma forma de criar sites e lojas ultrarrápidos, relevantes para cada audiência, e que evoluem diariamente através de experimentos e dados, [agende uma demo](https://deco.cx)."},{"img":"https://ozksgdmyrqcxcwhnbepg.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/assets/530/9cd72d58-1a57-443f-83a3-d263105670ff","date":"03/12/2023","path":"abertura-ii-hackathon-deco.md","descr":"Discurso da abertura da segunda Hackathon deco.cx.","title":"América Latina e o futuro das experiências digitais","author":"Guilherme Rodrigues","content":"Estou extremamente empolgado em dar início à nossa segunda Hackathon deco.cx! Mas antes de começarmos, eu quero dividir algumas palavras com vocês.\n\nNós estamos reunidos aqui hoje para aprender, criar e, se tudo der certo, levar para casa um prêmio de 500 reais. Mas acreditem, esse prêmio não é o melhor que vocês vão levar daqui — longe disso.\n\nA verdadeira recompensa é a oportunidade de adquirir novas habilidades que os diferenciam e os elevam a outro patamar como desenvolvedores e desenvolvedoras. E ainda maior que isso: a oportunidade de protagonizar a próxima geração de desenvolvimento web global.\n\nO estado atual de complexidade acumulada no desenvolvimento web é insustentável. Os anos de desenvolvimento na \"câmara de eco\" dos frameworks JS gerou uma enorme fricção, uma grande barreira de entrada para desenvolver web apps.\n\nCada vez é necessário aprender mais frameworks, padrões e bibliotecas para ser minimamente produtivo. O tempo de build de sites baseados nessas stacks limitam nossa criatividade no dia a dia. Além disso, temos grandes dificuldades de entregar sites performáticos. Não precisa ser assim!\n\nVivemos em um momento único na história do desenvolvimento web. Deno está no início de uma revolução que transformará a maneira como criamos e entregamos experiências digitais. E nós temos a chance de aproveitar essa janela de oportunidade para nos destacarmos no mercado global.\n\nDeno, junto com tecnologias como Fresh e Tailwind, representam a esperança de uma nova direção. Essas tecnologias nos mostraram como é possível ser simples e eficiente. Estamos vendo nascer o próximo Node.js, diante de nossos olhos — e estamos convidados a participar e a co-criá-lo!\n\nPor outro lado, a demanda global por digitalização só acelera. Demanda por projetos, demanda por sites, demanda por pessoas desenvolvedoras. E nós temos muita oferta de talento brasileiro — jovens pessoas desenvolvedoras, muitas vezes com dificuldade de se colocar no mercado de trabalho apesar de seu grande potencial.\n\nNós temos a oportunidade de atender essa demanda, mostrando o incrível potencial dos desenvolvedores brasileiros. Não precisamos apenas seguir as tendências; podemos liderar e nos tornar referência mundial na criação de experiências digitais de alta performance.\n\nMas a nossa responsabilidade não termina com o domínio dessas tecnologias. Para promover uma mudança estrutural, não basta garantirmos o nosso próprio sucesso. Devemos nos esforçar para sermos mentores, treinarmos a próxima geração e multiplicarmos a tecnologia no Brasil, promovendo a inclusão e dando oportunidades a todos aqueles que desejam ingressar nesse mercado em constante crescimento: especialmente aqueles que previsivelmente não teriam acesso a elas.\n\nEntão, enquanto vocês participam desta Hackathon, lembrem-se do potencial que têm em mãos e da responsabilidade compartilhada. Que vocês aproveitem ao máximo essa oportunidade, tanto para o seu crescimento pessoal quanto para o desenvolvimento da nossa comunidade. Estamos construindo algo muito maior do que cada um de nós.\n\nDesejo a todos vocês um ótimo evento, repleto de aprendizado, colaboração e inovação.

Todos os dias.\", a plataforma foca na simplicidade no desenvolvimento, autonomia para edições/testes e foco em performance.\n\n## Primeira etapa - Conhecendo a Stack\n\nAntes de iniciar o desenvolvimento, precisei correr atrás das tecnologias que a deco.cx sugere para utilização.\n\nSão elas:\n\n### Preact\n\nPreact é uma biblioteca JS baseada no React, mas que promete ser mais leve e mais performática.\n\nA adaptação aqui, para quem já tem o React, não tende a ser complicada.\n\n### Deno\n\nDeno é um ambiente de execução de Javascript e Typescript, criado pelo mesmo criador do Node.js.\n\nCom uma boa aceitação entre os devs, a alternativa melhorada do Node.js promete se destacar no futuro.\n\n### Fresh\n\nFresh é um Framework que me deixou bem curioso. Nessa stack, podemos dizer que ele atua como um Next.\n\nApesar de não ter me aprofundado no Framework, não tive problemas aqui, afinal um dos pilares do Fresh é não precisar de configuração, além de não ter etapa de build.\n\n### Twind\n\nTwind é uma alternativa mais leve, rápida e completa do tão conhecido Tailwind.\n\nA adaptação é extremamente fácil para quem já trabalha com Tailwind, mas não era o meu caso.\n\nPequenos gargalos no começo, mas a curva de aprendizagem é curta e nas últimas seções eu já estava sentindo os efeitos (positivos).\n\n## Segunda Etapa - Conhecendo a ferramenta da deco.cx\n\nMeu objetivo aqui, era entender como a ferramenta me ajudaria a recriar a página deno.land, tornando os componentes editáveis pelo painel CMS.\n\n### Criação da Conta\n\nO Login foi bem simples, pode ser feito com Github ou Google.\n\n### Criação do Projeto\n\nNa primeira página, após logado, temos a opção de Criar um Novo Site.\n\nTive que dar um nome ao projeto e escolher o template padrão para ser iniciado.\n\n![](https://images.prismic.io/tavanoblog/2aa05cf7-37c8-4f0f-a9e6-305a61148f41_Screenshot+from+2023-01-02+23-40-38.png?auto=compress,format)\n\nAssim que o site é criado, **automaticamente** um repositório é montado no GitHub da [deco-sites](https://github.com/deco-sites) e um link da sua página na internet também.\n\nA partir dai, cada push que você fizer resultará no Deploy da aplicação no servidor e rapidamente será refletido em produção\n\n### Entendendo páginas e seções\n\nDentro do painel, podemos acessar a aba de \"Pages\"\n\n![](https://images.prismic.io/tavanoblog/e0ca9a8b-39f7-494d-845f-251115fbd3cf_Screenshot+from+2023-01-02+23-46-00.png?auto=compress,format)\n\nNessa parte, cada página do seu site estará listada, e assim que você clicar, você pode ver as seções que estão sendo utilizadas.\n\n![](https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/tavanoblog/4e0e9aac-b71b-4a9d-b05c-5f5866db1ff4_Screenshot+from+2023-01-02+23-47-36.png)\n\nDessa forma, fica fácil para uma pessoa não técnica conseguir criar novas páginas e adicionar/editar as seções.\n\nMas para entender como criar um modelo de seção, vamos para a terceira etapa.\n\n## Terceira Etapa - Integração do Código com a deco.cx\n\nComo eu tinha o objetivo de tornar as seções da página editáveis, eu precisei entender como isso deveria ser escrito no código.\n\nE é tão simples, quanto tipagem em Typescript, literalmente.\n\nDentro da estrutura no GitHub, temos uma pasta chamada _sections_, e cada arquivo _.tsx_ lá dentro se tornará uma daquelas seções no painel.\n\n![](https://images.prismic.io/tavanoblog/86021ef8-4a16-4256-be35-f4b6edb57ae5_Screenshot+from+2023-01-02+23-59-21.png?auto=compress,format)\n\nEm cada arquivo, deve ser exportado uma função default, que retorna um código HTML.\n\nDentro desse HTML, podemos utilizar dados que vem do painel, e para definir quais dados deverão vir de lá, fazemos dessa forma:\n\nexport interface Props {\n  image: LiveImage;\n  imageMobile: LiveImage;\n  altText: string;\n  title: string;\n  subTitle: string;\n}\n\nEsses são os campos que configurei para a seção _Banner_, e o resultado é esse no painel:\n\n![](https://images.prismic.io/tavanoblog/485b3680-82af-4c06-9a27-d3c1cde28404_Screenshot+from+2023-01-03+00-19-45.png?auto=compress,format)\n\nDepois recebi esses dados como Props, assim:\n\nexport default function Banner({ image, imageMobile, altText, subTitle, title }: Props,) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      //Your HTML code here\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nE o resultado final da seção é:\n\n![](https://images.prismic.io/tavanoblog/b0db1859-a120-49ba-8831-e0ef78034f4d_Screenshot+from+2023-01-03+00-07-08.png?auto=compress,format)\n\n### Dev Mode\n\nÉ importante ressaltar, que durante o desenvolvimento, a ferramenta oferece uma função \"Dev Mode\".\n\nIsso faz com que os campos editáveis do painel se baseiem no código feito no localhost e não do repositório no Github.\n\nGarantindo a possibilidade de testes durante a criação.\n\n## Resultado Final + Conclusão\n\nO resultado final, pode ser conferido em: [https://deno-land.deco.site/](https://deno-land.deco.site/)\n\nConsegui atingir nota 97 no Pagespeed Mobile e isso me impressionou bastante.\n\nParticularmente, gostei muito dos pilares que a deco.cx está buscando entregar, em especial a autonomia de edição e o foco na velocidade de carregamento.\n\nA ferramenta é nova e já entrega muita coisa legal. A realização desse desafio foi feita após 3 meses do início do desenvolvimento da plataforma da deco.\n\nMinha recomendação a todos é que entrem na [Comunidade no Discord](https://discord.gg/deco-cx) e acompanhem as novidades para não ficar para trás.\n\nSe possível, criem um site na ferramenta e façam os seus próprios testes.\n\nEm parceria com [TavanoBlog](https://tavanoblog.com.br/)."},{"img":"https://i.insider.com/5e6bb1bd84159f39f736ee32?width=2000&format=jpeg&auto=webp","date":"11/29/2022","path":"pg-vb-pt-br.md","descr":"Por Paul Graham, traduzido por ChatGPT.","title":"A vida é curta","author":"Chat GPT","content":"A vida é curta, como todos sabem. Quando era criança, costumava me perguntar sobre isso. A vida realmente é curta ou estamos realmente nos queixando de sua finitude? Seríamos tão propensos a sentir que a vida é curta se vivêssemos 10 vezes mais tempo?\n\nComo não parecia haver maneira de responder a essa pergunta, parei de me perguntar sobre isso. Depois tive filhos. Isso me deu uma maneira de responder à pergunta e a resposta é que a vida realmente é curta.\n\nTer filhos me mostrou como converter uma quantidade contínua, o tempo, em quantidades discretas. Você só tem 52 fins de semana com seu filho de 2 anos. Se o Natal-como-mágica dure, digamos, dos 3 aos 10 anos, só poderá ver seu filho experimentá-lo 8 vezes. E enquanto é impossível dizer o que é muito ou pouco de uma quantidade contínua como o tempo, 8 não é muito de alguma coisa. Se você tivesse uma punhado de 8 amendoins ou uma prateleira de 8 livros para escolher, a quantidade definitivamente pareceria limitada, independentemente da sua expectativa de vida.\n\nOk, então a vida realmente é curta. Isso faz alguma diferença saber disso?\n\nFez para mim. Isso significa que argumentos do tipo \"A vida é muito curta para x\" têm muita força. Não é apenas uma figura de linguagem dizer que a vida é muito curta para alguma coisa. Não é apenas um sinônimo de chato. Se você achar que a vida é muito curta para alguma coisa, deve tentar eliminá-la se puder.\n\nQuando me pergunto o que descobri que a vida é muito curta, a palavra que me vem à cabeça é \"besteira\". Eu percebo que essa resposta é um pouco tautológica. Quase é a definição de besteira que é a coisa de que a vida é muito curta. E ainda assim a besteira tem um caráter distintivo. Há algo falso nela. É o alimento junk da experiência. [1]\n\nSe você perguntar a si mesmo o que gasta o seu tempo em besteira, provavelmente já sabe a resposta. Reuniões desnecessárias, disputas sem sentido, burocracia, postura, lidar com os erros de outras pessoas, engarrafamentos, passatempos viciantes mas pouco gratificantes.\n\nHá duas maneiras pelas quais esse tipo de coisa entra em sua vida: ou é imposto a você ou o engana. Até certo ponto, você tem que suportar as besteiras impostas por circunstâncias. Você precisa ganhar dinheiro e ganhar dinheiro consiste principalmente em realizar tarefas. De fato, a lei da oferta e da demanda garante isso: quanto mais gratificante é algum tipo de trabalho, mais barato as pessoas o farão. Pode ser que menos tarefas sejam impostas a você do que você pensa, no entanto. Sempre houve uma corrente de pessoas que optam por sair da rotina padrão e vão viver em algum lugar onde as oportunidades são menores no sentido convencional, mas a vida parece mais autêntica. Isso pode se tornar mais comum.\n\nVocê pode reduzir a quantidade de besteira em sua vida sem precisar se mudar. A quantidade de tempo que você precisa gastar com besteiras varia entre empregadores. A maioria das grandes organizações (e muitas pequenas) está imersa nelas. Mas se você priorizar conscientemente a redução de besteiras acima de outros fatores, como dinheiro e prestígio, pode encontrar empregadores que irão desperdiçar menos do seu tempo.\n\nSe você é freelancer ou uma pequena empresa, pode fazer isso no nível de clientes individuais. Se você demitir ou evitar clientes tóxicos, pode diminuir a quantidade de besteira em sua vida mais do que diminui sua renda.\n\nMas, enquanto alguma quantidade de besteira é inevitavelmente imposta a você, a besteira que se infiltra em sua vida enganando-o não é culpa de ninguém, mas sua própria. E ainda assim, a besteira que você escolhe pode ser mais difícil de eliminar do que a besteira que é imposta a você. Coisas que o atraem para desperdiçar seu tempo precisam ser muito boas em enganá-lo. Um exemplo que será familiar para muitas pessoas é discutir online. Quando alguém contradiz você, está, de certa forma, atacando você. Às vezes bastante abertamente. Seu instinto quando é atacado é se defender. Mas, assim como muitos instintos, esse não foi projetado para o mundo em que vivemos agora. Contrariamente ao que parece, é melhor, na maioria das vezes, não se defender. Caso contrário, essas pessoas estão literalmente tomando sua vida. [2]\n\nDiscutir online é apenas incidentalmente viciante. Há coisas mais perigosas do que isso. Como já escrevi antes, um subproduto do progresso técnico é que as coisas que gostamos tendem a se tornar mais viciantes. Isso significa que precisaremos fazer um esforço consciente para evitar vícios, para nos colocarmos fora de nós mesmos e perguntarmos: \"é assim que quero estar gastando meu tempo?\"\n\nAlém de evitar besteiras, devemos procurar ativamente coisas que importam. Mas coisas diferentes importam para pessoas diferentes e a maioria precisa aprender o que importa para elas. Alguns são afortunados e percebem cedo que adoram matemática, cuidar de animais ou escrever e, então, descobrem uma maneira de passar muito tempo fazendo isso. Mas a maioria das pessoas começa com uma vida que é uma mistura de coisas que importam e coisas que não importam e só gradualmente aprende a distinguir entre elas.\n\nPara os jovens, especialmente, muita dessa confusão é induzida pelas situações artificiais em que se encontram. Na escola intermediária e na escola secundária, o que os outros estudantes acham de você parece ser a coisa mais importante do mundo. Mas quando você pergunta aos adultos o que eles fizeram de errado nessa idade, quase todos dizem que se importavam demais com o que os outros estudantes achavam deles.\n\nUma heurística para distinguir coisas que importam é perguntar a si mesmo se você se importará com elas no futuro. A coisa falsa que importa geralmente tem um pico afiado de parecer importar. É assim que o engana. A área sob a curva é pequena, mas sua forma se crava em sua consciência como uma alfinete.\n\nAs coisas que importam nem sempre são aquelas que as pessoas chamariam de \"importantes\". Tomar café com um amigo importa. Você não vai sentir depois que isso foi um desperdício de tempo.\n\nUma coisa ótima em ter crianças pequenas é que elas fazem você gastar tempo em coisas que importam: elas. Elas puxam sua manga enquanto você está olhando para o seu celular e dizem: \"você vai brincar comigo?\". E as chances são de que essa seja, de fato, a opção de minimização de besteira.\n\nSe a vida é curta, devemos esperar que sua brevidade nos surpreenda. E é exatamente isso que costuma acontecer. Você assume as coisas como garantidas e, então, elas desaparecem. Você acha que sempre pode escrever aquele livro, ou subir aquela montanha, ou o que quer que seja, e então percebe que a janela se fechou. As janelas mais tristes fecham quando outras pessoas morrem. Suas vidas também são curtas. Depois que minha mãe morreu, eu desejei ter passado mais tempo com ela. Eu vivi como se ela sempre estivesse lá. E, de maneira típica e discreta, ela incentivou essa ilusão. Mas era uma ilusão. Acho que muitas pessoas cometem o mesmo erro que eu cometi.\n\nA maneira usual de evitar ser surpreendido por algo é estar consciente disso. Quando a vida era mais precária, as pessoas costumavam ser conscientes da morte em um grau que agora pareceria um pouco morboso. Não tenho certeza do porquê, mas não parece ser a resposta certa lembrar constantemente da caveira pairando no ombro de todos. Talvez uma solução melhor seja olhar o problema pelo outro lado. Cultive o hábito de ser impaciente com as coisas que mais quer fazer. Não espere antes de subir aquela montanha ou escrever aquele livro ou visitar sua mãe. Você não precisa se lembrar constantemente por que não deve esperar. Apenas não espere.\n\nPosso pensar em mais duas coisas que alguém faz quando não tem muito de algo: tentar obter mais disso e saborear o que tem. Ambos fazem sentido aqui.\n\nComo você vive afeta por quanto tempo você vive. A maioria das pessoas poderia fazer melhor. Eu entre elas.\n\nMas você provavelmente pode obter ainda mais efeito prestando mais atenção ao tempo que tem. É fácil deixar os dias passarem voando. O \"fluxo\" que as pessoas imaginativas adoram tanto tem um parente mais sombrio que impede você de pausar para saborear a vida no meio da rotina diária de tarefas e alarmes. Uma das coisas mais impressionantes que já li não estava em um livro, mas no título de um: Burning the Days (Queimando os Dias), de James Salter.\n\nÉ possível diminuir um pouco o tempo. Eu melhorei nisso. As crianças ajudam. Quando você tem crianças pequenas, há muitos momentos tão perfeitos que você não consegue deixar de notar.\n\nTambém ajuda sentir que você tirou tudo de alguma experiência. O motivo pelo qual estou triste por minha mãe não é apenas porque sinto falta dela, mas porque penso em tudo o que poderíamos ter feito e não fizemos. Meu filho mais velho vai fazer 7 anos em breve. E, embora sinta falta da versão dele de 3 anos, pelo menos não tenho nenhum arrependimento pelo que poderia ter sido. Tivemos o melhor tempo que um pai e um filho de 3 anos poderiam ter.\n\nCorte implacavelmente as besteiras, não espere para fazer coisas que importam e saboreie o tempo que tem. É isso o que você faz quando a vida é curta.  \n\n---\n\nNotas\n\n[1] No começo, eu não gostei que a palavra que me veio à mente tivesse outros significados. Mas então percebi que os outros significados estão bastante relacionados. Besteira no sentido de coisas em que você desperdiça seu tempo é bastante parecida com besteira intelectual.\n\n[2] Escolhi esse exemplo de forma deliberada como uma nota para mim mesmo. Eu sou atacado muito online. As pessoas contam as mentiras mais loucas sobre mim. E até agora eu fiz um trabalho bastante medíocre de suprimir a inclinação natural do ser humano de dizer \"Ei, isso não é verdade!\".\n\nObrigado a Jessica Livingston e Geoff Ralston por ler rascunhos deste."},{"tags":[],"body":{}}]},"__resolveType":"site/loaders/blogPostLoader.ts"}
