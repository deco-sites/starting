# Revisions

It's very important to have control and autonomy to manage your pages and blocks
and have the ability to make and undo changes easily if needed. With that in
mind, _deco.cx_ allows you to access the history of all versions of pages and
blocks. This way, when editing a page or block on your site, you can click on
the `Revisions` tab to find out when and by which team member a change was made.

## Step by Step

1. Once you are logged into the Deco admin, you can access the website you want
   to work on.

2. Access the page or block you want to work on. For instance (remember to
   replace `$sitename` with your site's name):
   - If you want to access the `Page Listing`, go to
     `https://admin.deco.cx/sites/$sitename/pages`
   - If you want to access the `Section Listing`, go to
     `https://admin.deco.cx/sites/$sitename/sections`
   - There are other blocks that can be configured and accessed through the
     block listing at `https://admin.deco.cx/sites/$sitename/library`

3. On the right sidebar of the screen, you can see the page properties and a
   navigation bar with tabs such as `Form`, `JSON`, and `Revisions` (`↻`).

4. By clicking on the `Revisions` tab (`↻`), you can access a list of versions
   for that page (or block) and who was responsible for making them. You can
   also load the data from a version to use as a basis for the current edit.

   > To restore an old version, simply select the version to be restored and
   > click `Publish`.

5. When you make changes to any page or block, you need to click `Publish`,
   otherwise the changes made will be lost.

6. After that, a new revision will be published with the changes you just saved.

When you publish a version, it is live! If you need to create a version just to
test a page or component, or if it needs gradual and constant work, you can save
a draft. A draft is a variant that will never be used to fulfill any user
request.

If you are satisfied with the work, the draft can replace or take on the role of
the original variant (including the default variant).

So, remember:

- the latest version is always live and represents the current state of that
  element or page in production
- a draft is only a variant that is never used to fulfill requests on the site
  (but can be promoted to do so if the user desires)

# Releases

`Releases` holds the history of all published versions of your site and allows
you to quickly restore to previous versions if needed. To access the list of
published versions, click on the `Releases` tab on the top bar of your site's
homepage.

## Step by Step

1. When you access the `Releases` tab on the top bar, you can see a list of
   releases on the screen, but only one of them is published.
2. Once you publish a revision of any page or block, a new release will be
   generated. Therefore, when you access the `Releases` tab after some published
   modification, you will be able to see the new published version of the
   release listed along with the others.

3. If you prefer to republish a version of the previously published release,
   different from the current release, you can click on `...` and then click
   `Publish` to restore the chosen version.
