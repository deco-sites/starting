# Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have a ready Deco site, and the desired App
should be available in the Apps directory. If you're unsure how to do this,
refer to the
[tutorial on making an app installable](/docs/en/developing/making-an-app-installable).

# Apps

An `App` allows you to add new functionalities to your site in a straightforward
manner.

# Installing the App

1. **Access the Deco Admin:** Start by logging into your
   [Deco Admin](https://admin.deco.cx) account.

2. **Choose the Target Site:** After logging in, select the specific site where
   you want to install the App. You will be directed to the site's homepage.

3. **Access the "Apps" Section:** On the site's homepage, navigate to the "Apps"
   section. This is where you will find all the Apps available for installation.
   Select to view all "available Apps".

4. **Add an App Block:** Click on "Add" to install an App. This starts the
   process of creating a block. Configure the block and click on "Create" (give
   it a name; it's common to use the version, like `site@v0`).

5. **Explore Installed Blocks:** Once installed, you will have access to all the
   blocks and components that an App includes. These blocks can be integrated
   into your Deco site to provide additional functionality.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed an App using the Deco Admin.
Explore the new capabilities and features that an installed App brings to your
Deco site. Feel free to further customize the App or explore other available
Apps to expand the functionality of your Deco project. Enjoy managing and
enhancing your Deco site! ðŸš€

> You can always change the App settings by clicking on the created block.
