The site creation process will start and, after it finished, you'll see the
site's dashboard:

## Navigating on your site

You can see your site's URL right below your site name. This URL is public and
the site is already online.

You should see something similar to `https://deco-sites-start.deno.dev`, which
was the template chosen in the creation process.

> deco.cx is free up until 5.000 page view/visits per month. Check our
