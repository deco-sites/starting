# Connecting to Shopify

To connect to your Shopify account:

   [https://deco.cx/admin](https://deco.cx/admin "https://deco.cx/admin").
2. In the top bar, select _blocks_.
3. Choose the _Apps_ tab.

5. Change the account configuration from `gimenesdevstore` to your Shopify
   account name. The account name is necessarily what's in your public URL, for
   example: `gimenesdevstore.myshopify.com`.
6. Set the Storefront Access Token with all permissions
   [(help)](https://help.withkoji.com/en/articles/6619709-how-to-find-your-shopify-storefront-api-access-token).
7. Set the Admin Access Token only with the permissions you want (the process is
   the same as the Storefront token).
8. Click on `Save` and then `Publish`.

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations, you have set up the integration with Shopify. To ensure the
integration is working correctly, continue reading and create a reusable
collection block.
