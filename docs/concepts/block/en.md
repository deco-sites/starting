# Overview

Imagine being able to **serialize** a function and save it in a **database**. What if this function could be composed together with multiple options? How would that change the way you develop web applications?

In deco, the world revolves around **Blocks**. These Blocks are serialized functions that can be seamlessly composed together, allowing for limitless possibilities and customization.

With deco, you have the flexibility to use an `Inline Block` where you can create and use Blocks on the fly, or you can create a Block with a specific name and save it for future use, known as a `Saved Block`.

Using _deco_, developers have the ability to define **Blocks**. These **Blocks** are built on top of Deno, providing reusable and configurable _"packaged capabilities"_ that can be combined to create and deploy robust web applications within minutes. They enable developers to create modular and composable units of functionality. With Blocks, you can easily combine and integrate different capabilities to build complex and customized applications tailored to your specific needs.

## Customizing the Admin UI

The deco Admin UI itself is built using **Blocks**, making it highly customizable and extensible. Developers have the freedom to compose their own bespoke digital experience admin UIs that perfectly align with the requirements of their business users. With deco, you have complete control over your admin interface, ensuring that it precisely caters to your unique needs.

## Visual Library: Explore and Customize Blocks

In addition to the powerful **Blocks** framework, deco offers a _comprehensive visual library_ that allows you to **navigate through your blocks**. This visual library empowers you to explore various options and configurations for your site's components and features.

With the Visual Library, you have the flexibility to customize and fine-tune Blocks according to your specific requirements. You can easily edit and preview Blocks with different configurations, ensuring they align perfectly with your desired visual and functional elements.
