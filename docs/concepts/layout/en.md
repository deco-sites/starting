A _Page Layout_ is a pre-designed **page** that determines the structure and
visual design of pages on a site. It typically includes the placement of header,
footer, navigation menu, content areas, and other elements that make up a web
page. They are fully created using the deco.cx's Admin UI, without touching any
line of code.

_Page layouts_ are often created as reusable **pages** that can be applied to
other pages for a site. This makes it easier to maintain a consistent look and
feel across the entire site, while also simplifying the development process.

_Page layouts_ can also be customized for specific pages or sections of a site,
allowing for greater flexibility in design and content presentation. For
example, a blog post might have a different layout than a product page or a
contact page, depending on the type of content and the desired user experience.

One important aspect of page layouts is their responsiveness to different screen
sizes and devices. With the increasing use of mobile devices to access the web,
it's essential to ensure that page layouts are optimized for various screen
sizes and orientations. Responsive design techniques such as using fluid grid
systems, flexible images, and media queries can help ensure that page layouts
adapt to different devices and screen sizes.

Page layouts not only define how sections are arranged on a page, but they also
provide flexibility by **allowing you to define sections that will be used for
each page that shares the same layout**. This means that you can globally change
the content of a section by simply updating the base layout for your site's
pages.
