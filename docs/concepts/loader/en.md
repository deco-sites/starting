description: A Loader in deco.cx is a function that returns data needed for a Site.
since: 1.0.0

A **Loader** in _deco.cx_ is a Typescript function that returns data typically
needed in a [Section](/docs/en/concepts/section). These functions are executed
before page renders, and their main purpose is to **fetch data from external
sources**, transform it if necessary, and **provide it to the site Sections that
need it.** Loaders can be used to fetch data from APIs, databases, or any other
external source. They live locally on the `/loaders/` folder of your project,
but it's also possible to
[Installing apps](/docs/en/getting-started/installing-an-app) that contain
loaders.

<!-- TODO: Update folder name after new engine -->

In addition to fetching data, Loaders in _deco.cx_ **can also export a
Typescript Props type,** which allows them to be configured in the
[Admin](https://deco.cx/admin) just like [Sections](/docs/en/concepts/section).
This means that business users can configure details about how the Loader will
operate, such as **setting up filters or passing parameters to APIs.** By making
Loaders configurable in this way, it becomes easier to manage the data flowing
into Sections and ensure that the Site is displaying the right information to
visitors.

One other great benefit of Loaders in _deco.cx_ is that **multiple loaders can
return the same data type**. This allows [Sections](/docs/en/concepts/section)
that receive, for example, an array of canonical Product to get data from
different Loaders, depending on the user's configuration. This means that UIs
can be reused across [Sites](/docs/en/concepts/site) or across teams, making it
easier to manage and scale your project.

> All Sections for ecommerce stores created by _deco.cx_ in the
> [Storefront](https://github.com/deco-sites/storefront) start use a canonical
> Product type, and also every Loader that connects to ecommerce providers's
> APIs. This means that you can reuse the same UI to show data from different
> places, depending on the configuration.

## Example Code

This is the implementation of the `shopify/loaders/ProductList.ts` Loader:

```tsx
import type { Product } from "../../commerce/types.ts";
import { AppContext } from "../../shopify/mod.ts";
import { ListProducts } from "../utils/storefront/queries.ts";
import {
  ListProductsQuery,
  ListProductsQueryVariables,
} from "../utils/storefront/storefront.graphql.gen.ts";
import { toProduct } from "../utils/transform.ts";

export interface Props {
  /** @description search term to use on search */
  query: string;
  /** @description total number of items to display */
  count: number;
}

/**
 * @title Shopify Integration
 * @description Product List loader
 */
const loader = async (
  props: Props,
  _req: Request,
  ctx: AppContext,
): Promise<Product[] | null> => {
  const { storefront } = ctx;

  const count = props.count ?? 12;
  const query = props.query || "";

  const data = await storefront.query<
    ListProductsQuery,
    ListProductsQueryVariables
  >({
    variables: { first: count, query },
    ...ListProducts,
  });

  // Transform Shopify product format into schema.org's compatible format
  // If a property is missing from the final `products` array you can add
  // it in here
  const products = data?.products.nodes.map((p) =>
    toProduct(p, p.variants.nodes[0], new URL(_req.url))
  );

  return products ?? [];
};

export default loader;
```
