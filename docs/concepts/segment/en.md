# Segment: Targeting Specific User Groups

In deco, a **Segment** refers to a specific group or subset of users that meet certain conditions or criteria. Segments are a powerful tool that allow you to target and personalize content for specific user groups, providing tailored experiences and optimizing content delivery.

## Understanding Segments

Segments are defined by [Matchers](/docs/en/concepts/matchers), which evaluate conditions and determine whether a user belongs to a particular segment. Matchers can consider various factors such as user traits, date and time, device type, geographic location, and more. By leveraging Matchers, you can create dynamic and customized content variations based on these conditions.

## Utilizing Segments

Segments play a crucial role in various areas of deco, particularly in the context of [Variants](/docs/en/getting-started/variants). Variants enable you to create content variations and personalize the user experience based on different segments. By combining Matchers with different conditions, you can target specific user groups and deliver tailored content to enhance engagement and satisfaction.

Segments offer great flexibility and enable you to define different targeting strategies based on your specific goals and audience characteristics. Whether it's conducting A/B tests, displaying different content based on user traits, or customizing experiences based on location or device type, Segments empower you to optimize your website's performance and deliver a personalized user journey.

With the ability to define and utilize Segments in deco, you can create a highly targeted and engaging user experience, improving user satisfaction and achieving your business objectives.

Remember, Segments are defined by Matchers, so understanding how Matchers work and creating customized Matchers that suit your specific requirements will allow you to effectively leverage the power of Segments in deco.
