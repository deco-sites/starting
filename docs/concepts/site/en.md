It's important to understand the concept of a **Site** when building a website
or online store with _deco.cx_. A site is a collection of configurations like
[Audiences](/docs/en/concepts/audience), [Pages](/docs/en/concepts/page) and
[Sections](/docs/en/concepts/section) that are linked together and accessed
through a common domain or URL.

This is an example of a _deco.cx_'s Site: https://fashion.deco.site

> Every deco.cx Site gets a free *.deco.site domain.

Creating a site on _deco.cx_ automatically **deploys it online** and **creates a
repository** for easy code and content management. Users can choose from
templates that include base [Pages](https://deco.cx/en/concepts/page) and
[Sections](/docsen/concepts/section) to get started.

After creating the site, users can personalize it by editing content via
_deco.cx_'s admin on https://deco.cx/admin or changing the style and design via
code changes.

Which content each user will see from your Site will depend on your
[Audience](/docs/en/concepts/audience) configuration. Audiences allow content
personalization, A/B testing and creation of campaigns.

Sites are collaborative and **belong to a team** in our Admin. Team members can
be added so you can work on the site together.
