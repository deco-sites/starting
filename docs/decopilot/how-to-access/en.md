# Introducion
The Decopilot is a code generation tool designed to further streamline the website creation process. Seeking to combine the convenience of using artificial intelligence with the agility provided by [Deco Admin](https://admin.deco.cx/) for web application development, Decopilot provides the freedom to develop a website and its content within minutes while assisting you in identifying and fixing any potential errors during development.

# How to access

After [creating your site](https://deco.cx/docs/en/getting-started/creating-a-site), select the Code Widget in any of the sections of your site.
