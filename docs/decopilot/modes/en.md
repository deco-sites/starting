# Creating code for you

For code generation, Decopilot supports both text with the desired request and the insertion of local images. For both cases, you can choose to **accept the changes**, **discard** them, or **recreate** the provided code.

## Using text

When selecting the code option, you can explore code generation based on your current code and the creation of new components. For example, when using the prompt:

> Create a hero component with a title, subtitle, and call-to-action button in greenish tones.

After generating the code, Decopilot replaces your used code, and you can see the result in the preview.

## Using image

## Transform an image into code

If you wish to use an image as inspiration, Decopilot can reproduce it when receiving a local image in one of the supported formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WebP) along with the request of what to do.

## Create a component with an image

Similarly, by changing the user's request intention, it's possible for Decopilot to **insert the image as part of the requested component**, as shown in the example.

# Fixing errors

To further assist the development process, Decopilot can help you identify errors in your code and **fix them within seconds**.

# Explicando seu código
But understanding what's wrong and learning how to fix it is also important, right? That's where Decopilot comes in—it can **explain any part of your code**, from small snippets to the entire code if necessary, providing clarifications and guidance to address doubts and gain a better understanding of the code's workings.
