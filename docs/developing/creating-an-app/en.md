# Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- [Deno](https://deno.land/)
- [Deco CLI](https://deco.cx/docs/en/developing/getting-started#installation)

## Step 1: Initializing the Deco App

To kickstart your Deco App development, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
deno run -A https://deco.cx/init
```

This command will initialize a new Deco App project in your current directory. Choose a meaningful name for your app when prompted.

## Step 2: Navigate to Your Deco App Directory

After the initialization is complete, navigate to your Deco App directory using the following command:

```bash
cd $YOUR_APP_NAME
```

Replace `$YOUR_APP_NAME` with the name you chose for your Deco App during initialization.

## Step 3: Understanding the Files

Now, let's take a look at the files in your Deco App:

### `state.ts`

```ts
export interface State {
  url: string;
}
```

In this file, you define the shared state of your app. The state interface specifies the properties and their types that will be used by other components within your Deco App. For example, in the previous messages, the `state.ts` file was defined with a single property `url`.

### `mod.ts`

This file is automatically generated by Deco. It contains important configurations and imports that make your Deco App work seamlessly. The `AppContext` type should be imported from this file, allowing you to access the properties defined in `state.ts`.

### `loaders/bin.ts`

```ts
import { AppContext } from "../mod.ts";
export interface Props {
  status: number;
}
export default function GetBin(
  { status }: Props,
  _req: Request,
  ctx: AppContext,
): Promise<Response> {
  return fetch(`${ctx.url}/${status}`);
}
```

This is an example file representing one of the components you can create in your Deco App. In this example, we have a loader named `GetBin`, which fetches data from an API using the `ctx.url` defined in the shared state. The loader takes a `status` prop and performs a fetch based on the provided status.

## Step 4: Developing Your Deco App

Now that you understand the basic structure of your Deco App, you can start developing it. Feel free to add more components, such as sections, actions, workflows, or handlers, to enhance the functionality of your app.

## Step 5: Building Your Deco App

To see your Deco App in action, run the following command:

```bash
deno task start
```

This command will start your app and automatically generate the necessary files to make the app usable by any Deco site.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully created and developed your own Deco App. You've learned about the important files in your Deco App and how to access the shared state properties from other components. Deco Apps provide a powerful way to bundle and share business capabilities, making it easier to maintain and scale your Deco projects. Happy coding and feel free to explore more Deco features to further enhance your apps! ðŸš€
