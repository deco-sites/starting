## Clone your site repository

Accept the invitation to access the repository created for your site. This
invitation is sent to the email address of your Github profile.

Use the `git clone` command to download the code from the website to your
machine. We recommend using SSH. For this, open the terminal and run the
command:

```
git clone git@github.com:deco-sites/site-name.git
```

**Remember to change `site-name` to your site name.**

If you prefer, you can clone the repository using other methods, such as _git
https_ or via the _Github_ tool. On your repository page On _Github_ you can
find details about these different ways to clone.

_**main**_, which is the main branch.

You can go to _site-name.deco.site_ to see the latest version of your site on
air.
