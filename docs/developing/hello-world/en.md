description: Learn how to create a Section for a Site using deco.cx
---

In this tutorial you'll learn how to create a a new
[Section](/docs/en/concepts/section) implementation in your Site's source code
and see how users can **configure its props** on _deco.cx_'s Admin.

## Suggested Reading

- [Intro: Tech Stack](/docs/en/developing/setup)
- [Core Concept: Section](/docs/en/concepts/section)

Open the folder of your site's code in a IDE and perform the following actions:

1. Create a `.tsx` file in the `sections/` folder on your website with the name
   of the section you want to create (_e.g_: `LatestPosts.tsx`).

2. Export a [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) component **using `export default`**
   like the example below:

   1. `sections/LatestPosts.tsx`

      ```tsx
      export interface Props {
        title: string;
      }

      export default function LatestPosts({ title }: Props) {
        return (
          <div>
            <h1 class="font-bold">{title}</h1>
            <p>This is an example section</p>
          </div>
        );
      }
      ```

**That's it!** Now you have created this Section locally on your machine.

## Testing the Section

Even though the code for this Section is on _localhost_ only, you can see how
its UI is being rendered and also test the configuration of its props. For every
prop that you export we'll render a data input accordingly to the prop type.
It's also possible to load
[data fetched from external API's](/docs/en/developing/fetching-data)

To test the `LatestPosts.tsx` Section:

1. Run `deno task start` on the Terminal. _(You don't need to re-run if it was
   already running)_

2. Go to _deco.cx_'s Admin on https://deco.cx/admin, select your Site and go to
   `Library`.

3. Make sure that `localhost:8000` is selected in the Environment selector in
   the top-right of the page.

4. Look for `LatestPosts.tsx` in the left sidebar.

5. **That's it!** Now you can enter input props for that Section, hit `Save` and
   see how the UI is looking. If you change the Section's code locally the UI
   will automatically update as well.
