Our tech stack is designed to provide a **simple and efficient** solution for
web development, while also maintaining a strong focus on performance ðŸš€. If you
have previous experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, then working
with _deco.cx_ will be a breeze for you.

When you're building a website or online store with _deco.cx_, you have the
flexibility to create custom [Sections](/docs/en/concepts/section) and
[Loaders](/docs/en/concepts/loader) that fit your unique needs. To help you
create these components with ease and speed, we rely on a set of powerful and
efficient technologies.

Our tech stack is focused on **simplicity and performance**, making it
accessible to developers with previous experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
React. These are the key tools we use to power deco.cx sites:

### [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)

**Preact** is a fast and lightweight alternative to
[React.js](https://reactjs.org/), used for rendering UI components on both the
server and the client. It uses _JSX_ to create web components and it's usually
pretty simple to pick up.

### [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)

**Tailwind** is a CSS styling solution based on utility classes, which makes it
really easy for beginners. It is also optimized for performance.

### [Deno](https://deno.land/)

**Deno** is a JavaScript and TypeScript runtime environment. It is used to make
our websites, written in Typescript, run by a server. Deno is similar to Node.js
(_fun fact_: they were
[created by the same person](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA")).

### [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev)

**Fresh** is a fullstack web framework (backend and frontend) for JavaScript and
TypeScript. It was designed to make it easy to create applications high-quality,
high-performance and highly customizable web pages.

## Setup your environment

The only setup necessary to code _deco.cx_ sites is to **install Deno** on your
machine. To install Deno, follow the
[instructions on deno.land page](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation "https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation").

> We also expect you to have
> [Git installed](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).
