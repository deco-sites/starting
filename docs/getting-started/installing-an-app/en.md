# Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have a deco site ready, and the desired App should be available in the Apps directory. If you're unsure how to achieve this, refer to the [making an app installable tutorial](/docs/en/developing/making-an-app-installable).

## Step 1: Log in to deco Admin

Start by logging in to your deco Admin account. Visit [https://deco.cx/admin](https://deco.cx/admin) and enter your credentials.

## Step 2: Choose Your Target Site

After logging in, select the specific site where you want to install the App. You'll be directed to the site's home.

## Step 3: Access the "Apps" Section

In the site's home, navigate to the "Apps" section. This section is where you'll find all the Apps available for installation.

## Step 4: Add the App Block

Inside the "Apps" section, create a new App block. Give it a name; it's commonly used to specify the version, such as `site@v0` and publish it.

## Step 5: Configure the App

With the App block created, you'll also be prompted to fulfill any required configurations or parameters.

## Step 6: Save and Publish

After configuring the App block, click "Save and Publish" to apply the changes and install the App on your site.

## Step 7: Explore the Installed Blocks

Once the App is installed, you'll have access to all the blocks and components it includes. These blocks can be integrated into your deco site to provide additional functionalities.

Congratulations! You've successfully installed an App using deco Admin. Explore the newfound capabilities and features that the installed App brings to your deco site. Feel free to customize the App further or explore other available Apps to expand your deco project's functionalities. Enjoy managing and enhancing your deco site! ðŸš€
