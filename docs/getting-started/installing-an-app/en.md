# Prerequisites

- You must have a deco site with the desired App already available in the Apps directory by following the [making an app installable tutorial](/docs/en/developing/making-an-app-installable).

## Step 1: Log in to deco Admin

First, log in to your deco Admin account by navigating to [https://deco.cx/admin](https://deco.cx/admin).

## Step 2: Choose Your Target Site

Once you are logged in, choose the target site where you want to install the App. After selecting the site, you will be directed to the site home.

## Step 3: Open the Middleware URL

In the site home, open the following URL in your browser:

```
https://deco.cx/admin/sites/$SITE/blocks/.%2Froutes%2F_middleware.ts
```

Replace `$SITE` in the URL with the actual name of your site.

## Step 4: Access "Apps" and Choose "Installed Apps"

After opening the URL, you will be directed to a page that shows your site's middleware. Access the "Apps" section, and if "Installed Apps" is not chosen yet, select it from the options.
