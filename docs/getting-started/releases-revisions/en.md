# Revisions

It's very important to have control and autonomy to manage your pages and blocks and to be able to easily make and revert changes if necessary. With that in mind, _deco.cx_ allows you to have access to all versions of pages and blocks, either the ones that are published or the ones that have been changed but aren't published, and guarantees navigating between these versions remains very intuitive. This way, when editing a page or block on your site, you can click on the `Revisions` tab and find out when and by which team member the change was made.

## Step by step
1. Once you are already logged into the Deco's Admin, you can access the site you want to work with.
2. Access the page or block you want to work with. For instance (remember to replace `$sitename` with your site name):
    - If you want to access the `Page List`, go to <https://deco.cx/admin/sites/$sitename/pages>
    - If you want to access the `Blocks List`, go to <https://deco.cx/admin/sites/$sitename/library> 
3. On the right sidebar of the screen, you can see the page properties and a navigation bar with the `Form`, `JSON` and `Revisions` tabs.
4. By clicking on the `Revisions` tab, you can access a list of versions for this page (or block) and who was responsible for making them. You can also inspect what has changed between different versions by clicking on the version you want.
5. When you make changes to any page or block you need to click on `Save`, otherwise the changes you've made will be lost.
6. Afterwards, a new revision will be generated with the change you just saved. However, it's important to keep in mind that this version is not yet published.<img width="1440" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84691125/253417839-2d3bc0ea-6f0a-43bc-9d4e-c90001dbe5da.png">
7. If you want the changes you've made to be published, after saving you need to click on `Publish`, to replace the current published version of your page or to create an A/B test with your changes.<img width="1440" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84691125/253417892-d188bb57-6c31-414e-b59b-9911b2132c43.png">

# Releases 

`Releases` holds the history of all published versions of your site, and allow you to quickly restore to previous versions if needed. To access the list of published versions, click on the `Releases` tab on the top bar of your site's home page. 

## Step by step
1. When you access the `Release` tab, you can see a list of releases on the screen, but only one of them is published.
2. Once you publish a revision of any page or block, a **new release** version will be generated. This way, when accessing the `Releases` tab, you'll be able to see the new published version listed among the other ones.<img width="1440" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84691125/253418144-cb7a7081-b8c4-40b8-9794-3b33157650bf.png">
3. If you prefer to republish a previously published version of a release other than the current one, you can click on `â€¦` and then click on `Publish` to restore your chosen version. <img width="1440" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84691125/253418205-d482c02c-7344-401d-8862-521370148f69.png">
