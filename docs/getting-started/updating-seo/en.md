   How to edit a block in deco.cx
---

Using deco.cx's Admin you can change the site's content without needing to change the code, thanks to the [Blocks](/docs/en/concepts/blocks) concept.

The first Block we can edit is the **SEO**, a saved Section that is used by the site's home page. This block configures important metadata about the page such as **title, description and thumbnail** (this information is used in social media previews).

Conveniently, you can preview how **SEO** is set up in the site's dashboard.

Click on **Edit** on the top right to change its data. You will be redirected to the block editing page.

Our block editor is divided into two sections:

1. **Preview**: see how your block will be rendered, on the left. _(or some helpful UI if you're editing metadata)._
2. **Form**: edit the information that was made available by developers.

In the page's _topbar_, you have access to:
- **URL bar**: test specific URLs for the block you are editing (useful for product pages, for example).
- **Performance Metrics:** check which resources this block is using and the amount of Javascript sent to the browser.
- **View/Edit Toggle**: Disable automatic _overlay_ in preview to test interactive block elements.

Any changes you make to the form are **automatically reflected** in the preview on the left. When you're editing pages, you can also use preview to select specific Sections and reorder them right on the page.

## Editing the SEO

Edit your site's SEO title, description, and image to suit what you're building, and ensure social media previews behave as expected. You can test different versions to see what fits best.

After that, **click the Save button** on the top right to create a new revision of this block. Revisions are immutable versions of the edited data in the deco and are meant to be able to track and revert changes over time. Learn more about [here](/docs/en/getting-started/releases-revisio ns).

## Publishing the changes

To actually change your site's SEO _meta tags_, you need to publish the current revision you just saved. **Click the Publish button** to make the changes effective.
