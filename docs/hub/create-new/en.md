description: Integrate external services into deco.cx using apps
since: 1.0.0
---

## Prerequisites

- Created and developed a deco.cx site.
- [Concepts: App](/docs/en/concepts/app)

## Objectives

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate new services into deco.cx by
**creating a app** on Deco Hub. We'll use an external API (RandomData) as an
example, but you can use apps for several use cases, like:

- Review providers _(e.g: PowerReviews, Opini√µes Verificadas)_.
- External CMSes _(e.g: Wordpress, Sanity)_
- UI widgets _(e.g: SizeBay, chatbots)_

## Forking the deco-cx/apps repository

The first step to develop an app is to **fork the
[deco-cx/apps](https://github.com/deco-cx/apps)**. You can do it inside Github
by accessing the repo link.

<img width="1092" alt="Forking deco-cx apps repository" src="https://github.com/deco-cx/apps/assets/18706156/cea1d418-f67e-4943-8358-d43357f95a7d">

After forking it, you'll have your own version of `deco-cx/apps`, usually hosted
on your personal organization (`{yourusername}/apps`). This repository will be
used to develop the app and, after finished, you'll **submit a Pull Request** to
the original repository.

If you have questions about this flow, read about
[contributing to open-source](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects).

## Structure

In the root folder of the repo, you'll see a lot of folders. Each one of those
represents an app. It's recommended that you take a look into those examples so
you can better understand.

![List of apps in deco-cx/apps](https://github.com/deco-cx/apps/assets/18706156/d6d0c90e-c348-4ca7-9d59-8c44aef522d2)

## The example use case

To better illustrate the app's capabilities and also demonstrate how to convert
ecommerce data, we will build an app called `random-products` and it'll simulate
an external search provider, but getting random data from
[Random Data API](https://random-data-api.com/). We will use the
`https://random-data-api.com/api/v2/beers?size=4` endpoint which returns a list
of beers, and will complement with mocked information (like the product's image
and price).

We'll create a `productList.ts` loader which can be used in deco.cx's Product
Shelves and other components that require `Product[] | null`.

## Creating an app

It's important to first understand what you want to accomplish. If you want to
**extend an existing application, you don't need to create a new app,** just
create/update files inside the app that already exists. Since we want to create
an integration with a new service, let's create an app:

1. Inside the `apps` root folder, run `deno task new random-product`.
2. Open the code in your IDE and verify that a `random-product` folder was
   created.

## mod.ts

The `mod.ts` is the entrypoint of the application, and it **defines the
configuration type for the app**. The most common usecase for this is to declare
metadata that is important to all of the app's capabilities, like **API Keys,
account names, language**. You can check the example in `typesense/mod.ts`.
These values will be **filled by the end user whenever they want to install the
app.**

Since our API (Random Data) doesn't require any specific authentication key,
let's include only one prop for the root endpoint (in this case, it needs to be
filled with `https://random-data-api.com`).

```tsx
export type Props = {
  /** @description Use https://random-data-api.com if not specified*/
  rootEndpoint: string;
};
```

> Tip: You can use any of the [Utility Types](/docs/en/reference/utility-types)
> that you already know.

It's also in this file that you can make clients/services available to the app's
loaders and actions, in order to simplify REST/GraphQL calls. Let's check how to
use this feature.

## Creating the HTTP client

Most of the integrations will require making requests to an external API via
REST or GraphQL. In order to provide a better Developer Experience, we provide a
`createHTTPClient` and `createGraphqlClient` that can be used to call external
endpoints with type-safety. You can see an example of this in `wake/mod.ts`.

> deco.cx automatically generates typing definitions for OpenAPI specifications.
> Just drop the JSON export for the api in `*.openapi.json` file and run
> `deno task start`. You can see an example in the `wake` app.

Let's model the API we're targeting in a `api-typings.d.ts` file in the app. To
quickly generate the response's type, use
[QuickType](https://app.quicktype.io/). The end result looks like this:

```ts
export interface Beer {
  id: number;
  uid: string;
  brand: string;
  name: string;
  style: string;
  hop: string;
  yeast: string;
  malts: string;
  ibu: string;
  alcohol: string;
  blg: string;
}

export interface RandomDataApi {
  /**
   * Random beers
   */
  "GET /api/v2/beers": {
    response: Beer[];
    searchParams: {
      size?: number;
    };
  };
}
```

Now, let's return to our `mod.ts` and properly create the client using the
typing definition we've just created. After adjusting the types, the file will
look like this:

```ts
import type { App, AppContext as AC } from "deco/mod.ts";
import manifest, { Manifest } from "./manifest.gen.ts";
import { createHttpClient } from "../utils/http.ts";
import { fetchSafe } from "../utils/fetch.ts";
import type { RandomDataApi } from "./api-typings.d.ts";

export type Props = {
  /** @description Use https://random-data-api.com if not specified */
  rootEndpoint: string;
};

/**
 * @title random-product
 */
export default function App(
  { rootEndpoint }: Props,
) {
  const randomApi = createHttpClient<RandomDataApi>({
    base: `${rootEndpoint}`,
    headers: new Headers({
      "content-type": "application/json",
    }),
    fetcher: fetchSafe,
  });

  const state = {
    randomApi,
  };

  const app: App<Manifest, typeof state> = {
    manifest,
    state,
  };
  return app;
}

export type AppContext = AC<ReturnType<typeof App>>;
```

You can check other client example in `vtex/mod.ts`, using both HTTP and
GraphQL.

## Creating productList loader

Since our goal is to return product data that can be used in a Product Shelf UI,
let's create a [Loader](/docs/en/concepts/loader) that does just that. In this
loader, we will:

1. Declare the props that users will fill in deco's admin.
2. Call the Random Data API using the `randomApi` client.
3. Transform the data returned from the API into deco's `Product` type.

The 3rd step (transforming the data) is quite iterative, so **it's better to
have the loader working first** and then work on the transformation. So, follow
these steps:

1. Create a `loaders` folder inside of the `random-product` app folder.
2. Create a `productList.ts` file.
3. Paste the following boilerplate:

```ts
import type { Product } from "../../commerce/types.ts";
import { AppContext } from "../mod.ts";

export interface Props {
  /** @description total number of items to display */
  count: number;
}

/**
 * @title Random Products
 */
const loader = async (
  props: Props,
  _req: Request,
  ctx: AppContext,
): Promise<Product[] | null> => {
  const { randomApi } = ctx;

  const count = props.count ?? 12;

  const beers = await randomApi["GET /api/v2/beers"]({ size: count }).then((
    r,
  ) => r.json());

  console.log({ beers });

  const products = await Promise.resolve([]);

  return products ?? [];
};

export default loader;
```

Now that the loader is created (returning only an empty array for now), let's
connect it with a deco site and see it working in the Admin.

## Testing our app locally

In order to test our loader, we need to install the app in a deco site. And, to
make the `random-product` app installable, we first need to include it in Deco
Hub (which itself is an app) and "build" our application. To do that:

1. Create a `random-product.ts` file inside `decohub/apps`.
2. Paste the following line:

`export { default } from "../../random-product/mod.ts";`

3. Run `deno task start` in the `apps` root folder _(not `apps/deco-hub/apps`,
   but `apps`_.)

After this, the manifests will be generated and the apps will be ready. If
anything is not right, the process will let you know.

Now, to test our app, let's use a deco site we have available and **link it
locally** so we can check that everything is working fine. I'll use
[`storefront`](https://github.com/deco-sites/storefront) but you can use any
other site that have `decohub.ts` installed. If you don't have a site yet,
create a new one and select `storefront-vtex` as a template.

1. Place the site's repository in the same folder as the `apps` repo you've been
   working with.
2. Open the site's code and then open the `import_map.json` file.
3. Replace the value of the `"apps"` entry to `"../apps/`.
4. Run `deno task start` in the site's root folder.

If everything is ok, the site should be running and accessible via
<http://localhost:8000>.

Let's go to deco's admin for this site to finish our setup.

<!-- Update this after our new apps installation process  -->

1. Access <http://localhost:8000>.
2. Press `.` on your keyboard to be redirected to the CMS.
3. Click on `Apps` to go to the Apps page in Admin.
4. In the top right, change the environment to `http://localhost:8000`.
5. Search for `random-product.ts`. You should see a row representing the app
   that was just created. Refresh the page otherwise.
6. Click on the `+` button to start instaling that app.
7. Fill `https://random-data-api.com` in the `Root Endpoint` field.
8. Click on `Save` and give it a meaningful name _(e.g: `random-product-app`)_.
9. After having saved the block, click on `Publish`.

Now, the app is installed in that site. This means that our `productList.ts`
loader should be available to use. Let's check:

1. Go back to the `Blocks` page.
2. Select the `Loaders` tab.
3. Search for `productList` and select the one that is from `random-product`.
4. Fill the `Count` with a number like `4`.
5. You should see an empty response (because the loader is returning []) but the
   list of beers should be logged in the server's console.

<img width="1509" alt="Console of the running loader" src="https://github.com/deco-cx/apps/assets/18706156/f8e79159-3c37-4864-a972-6a90489889ef">

Ok, now the loader is running and logging data that comes from the Random Data
API.

## Transforming the data

Our objective with this loader is to power UI components that display products
(like the Product Shelf) and, in order to do this, we need to transform our data
into the expected type for that Sections.

deco.cx uses the [Schema.org's](https://schema.org/Product) data type in its
components so that the community can use the same code to connect with different
ecommerce platforms. Because of that, **we need to transform the data inside our
loader** to match the same type.

<img width="1013" alt="image" src="https://github.com/deco-sites/std/assets/18706156/27c54c61-60ab-430c-bca4-8de6c6669b5b">

Let's create a `utils/transform.ts` file in our app which will hold the
transforming function from the input type (`Beer`) to the output type
(`Product`). Let's start with this snippet:

```ts
import type { Product } from "../../commerce/types.ts";
import { DEFAULT_IMAGE } from "../../commerce/utils/constants.ts";
import { Beer } from "../api-typings.d.ts";

export const toProduct = (
  beer: Beer,
  url: URL,
): Product => {
  // @ts-expect-error: Still a work in progress
  return {};
};
```

This tutorial only includes the Product List loader, but if you're integrating a
completely new commerce platform you'll need to also transform data related to
SEO and Search Filters.

Let's call this function inside of our `productList` loader, mapping our data
over this function:

```ts
import { toProduct } from "../utils/transform.ts"
// ...

  const products = beers.map((beer) => toProduct(beer, new URL(req.url)));

  return products ?? [];
};
```

The `toProduct` function is not doing anything right now, but it's connected to
the loader. From now on, we need to **understand the data and create the
mappings**. This is a very iterative step and I recommend that you do it already
testing with a UI section. Let's preview a `ProductShelf` in deco's admin
connected with our loader and see where it falls off.

<img width="1512" alt="Error Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'url') previewing a Product Shelf" src="https://github.com/deco-sites/storefront/assets/18706156/cc77d386-ff4a-4ee7-955a-4493c009834d">

You should see some errors because the section access some properties that we
are not passing yet (like the one above), but seeing this can be helpful as it
leads to what needs to be resolved in the transform function.

Since we're using a mock API that doesn't provide a lot of data, we'll have to
hardcode some values. This is the final mapping function we've created:

```ts
export const toProduct = (
  beer: Beer,
  url: URL,
): Product => {
  return {
    "@type": "Product",
    productID: beer.uid,
    url: `${url.origin}/beers/${beer.uid}`,
    name: beer.name,
    description: beer.style,
    sku: `${beer.id}`,
    brand: { "@type": "Brand", name: beer.brand },
    additionalProperty: [{
      "@type": "PropertyValue",
      name: "hop",
      value: beer.hop,
    }],
    image: [DEFAULT_IMAGE],
    offers: {
      "@type": "AggregateOffer",
      priceCurrency: "BRL",
      highPrice: 100,
      lowPrice: 100,
      offerCount: 1,
      offers: [{
        "@type": "Offer",
        price: 100,
        availability: "https://schema.org/InStock",
        inventoryLevel: { value: 10 },
        priceSpecification: [{
          "@type": "UnitPriceSpecification",
          priceType: "https://schema.org/SalePrice",
          price: 100,
        }],
      }],
    },
  };
};
```

After saving the code and checking the ProductShelf again, we should see the
following:

<img width="1508" alt="image" src="https://github.com/deco-sites/std/assets/18706156/8b9e2fb6-f6a8-45f1-89ec-ea9e57b450f5">

And that's it! The Random Product `productList` loader is working and can
already be integrated into deco's UI sections.

We are using sample data that doesn't represent what's usually returned from
search and ecommerce providers. **In a real scenario, it's important to correcly
map the data to schema.org's data types.**

## Deploying

Now that the app is already and included in deco hub, **create a Pull Request**
and send us at https://deco.cx/discord (`#deco-prs` channel).
