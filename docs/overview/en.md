## What is deco.cx

### The Old Web is broken, complicated and fragmented.

For the last 10 years, our team built high-volume, mission-critical websites and applications. We tested out most new frameworks and frontend architectures from KnockoutJS to React to GraphQL. Reflecting on our challenges and results, we believe <u>the current state of web development is broken</u>:

<div style="margin: 0 2rem">

🧩 <u>The complexity to build and deploy a web application has grown</u> steadily, discouraging junior developers from building the web.

😓 <u>Developers and content creators often struggle to collaborate</u> because the Headless CMS becomes a silo, requiring a lot of time to integrate and evolve;

🐢 <u>Client-side-first apps have terrible performance for high-volume</u>, content-driven websites like ecommerce storefronts, shipping ever-growing amounts of JavaScript code. 

</div>

We wanted a simpler way for web developers to build and collaborate with their marketing peers, using modern web technologies, and without having to configure so much stuff.  "No-code" is not enough, and often removes power from developers. We wanted to have one environment from code to content to data. We wanted to build the other side of code, a collaborative experience builder for developers and content creators to work together in.

## Making webdev straightforward for teams of all sizes

That's why we created deco.cx: a complete webdev platform for developers and content teams to build collaborative experiences together. <u>Developers write components and functions using Deno, JSX, HTMX, TypeScript, and Tailwind</u>. We automatically generate a beautiful, visual admin UI from the TypeScript code!  

Forget the costly and complex setup of a Headless CMS, or the inflexible structure of a no-code prison. deco.cx offers a seamless solution, making webdev straightforward for teams of all sizes:

## Why choose deco.cx

### From code to collaborative content — build your own bespoke no-code solution

Dealing with ”content type” editors is a PITA. With deco.cx, you just <u>write React (JSX) components with TypeScript</u> and we <u>automatically generate a no-code editor</u> that matches your Props.
