### Summary

> Deco provides Image, Picture, and Source components to work with images. These
> components add responsive patterns to speed up your site. To add an image to
> your site:
>
> 1. Add the deco image components (`<Image/>`, `<Source>`, `<Picture>`) to your
   > code
> 2. Style the components with CSS until you achieve the desired appearance
> 3. Set the width and height attributes of the component.

> The deco components already provide:
>
> - Responsive images for all screen sizes
> - Preloading tags to improve LCP
> - Image processing to optimize image size

# Image or Picture

There are two components for displaying images: `<Image>` and `<Picture>`. The
appropriate component depends on your use case:

- `<Image>` displays an image (internally using `<img>`) and is useful for
  images that always have the same aspect ratio (width vs height) regardless of
  screen size.

<img src="/docs/image-aspect-ratio.png">

- `<Picture>` defines images that can vary in size according to the screen
  resolution.

<img src="/docs/picture-aspect-ratio.png">

# Adding an image

Using the appropriate component, style it with Tailwind classes. It is mandatory
to set the src and use the height/width props:

```tsx
import Image from "apps/website/components/Image.tsx";

export default function MeuComponente() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="https://example.com/image.png"
      class="w-full h-full object-cover"
      width={800}
      height={1200}
    />
  );
}
```

The width/height does not change the size of the image on the screen as it is
styled by CSS. These attributes don't even need to be the original size of the
image. The height and width are present to allow the server and browser to
choose the appropriate image to download based on the user's screen resolution.

# Adding a Picture

Below, you will find a minimal example that renders an image for desktop and
another one for mobile devices.

```tsx
import { Picture, Source } from "apps/website/components/Picture.tsx";

function MeuComponente() {
  return (
    <Picture>
      <Source
        media="(max-width: 768px)"
        src="https://example.com/image-mobile.png"
        width={270}
        height={377}
      />
      <Source
        media="(min-width: 768px)"
        src="https://example.com/image-desktop.png"
        width={800}
        height={1200}
      />
      <img
        src="https://example.com/image-desktop.png"
        class="w-full h-full object-cover"
      />
    </Picture>
  );
}
```

> Note that you should use the `<img>` tag inside Picture, not the `<Image>`
> component. Also note that the `src` attribute in the `<img>` tag is REQUIRED
> and should receive the larger image, in this case, the desktop image.

The example above renders the `/image-mobile.png` image for screen sizes up to
768px wide. For larger screen sizes, the `/image-desktop.png` image will be
rendered.

To style this image, add classes to the `<img>` tag. For example, to make the
image fill the available space, as shown in the example above.

# Finding the width and height properties

The `width` and `height` attributes of the image can be confusing, even for
experienced developers. This confusion arises from the fact that these
attributes DO NOT change the final size of the rendered image on the screen.
Instead, they affect the image that the browser will download in a responsive
image scenario. Choosing appropriate width and height values is key to
downloading a small image for good LCP results.

To find a good width and height value:

1. Open your website and inspect the image element.
2. Set the viewport to the desired size (412px for mobile devices or 1440px for
   desktop).
3. Hover over the image tag. You should see something like:
   <img src="/docs/width-attribute.png" />
4. Voil√†! A good width and height value is available in the "Rendered size"
   attribute. In this case, the `width` is 270px and the `height` is 377px.

# Loading images in an optimized way (improving LCP)

For a good LCP, not only do you need to send small payloads, but you also need
to load them in the correct order, prioritizing those that are visible on the
screen over other elements (below the fold). A good heuristic is:

1. Prioritize the LCP image.
2. Lazy load all other images.

Fortunately, the `<Image>` and `<Picture>` components from Deco help us achieve
this behavior. Start by identifying the largest element on the screen (LCP).
Then, open the component's code and check if:

1. The `preload` attribute is set.
2. The `loading` attribute is set to 'eager'.
3. The `fetchPriority` attribute is set to 'high'.

For example, for an `<Image/>` component:

```tsx
import Image from "apps/website/components/Image.tsx";

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="https://example.com/image.png"
      width={270}
      height={377}
      preload
      loading="eager"
      fetchPriority="high"
    />
  );
}
```

For a `<Picture/>`:

```tsx
import { Picture, Source } from "apps/website/components/Picture.tsx";

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Picture preload>
      <Source
        media="(max-width: 768px)"
        src="https://example.com/image-mobile.png"
        width={270}
        height={377}
      />
      <Source
        media="(min-width: 768px)"
        src="https://example.com/image-desktop.png"
        width={800}
        height={1200}
      />
      <img
        loading="eager"
        fetchPriority="high"
        src="https://example.com/image-desktop.png"
        class="w-full h-full object-cover"
      />
    </Picture>
  );
}
```

Make sure that other images do not have the `preload` attribute and have the
`loading="lazy"` and `fetchPriority="low"` attributes. By adding these
configurations, you will optimize the image loading to improve LCP.

> **Tip**: The final page should have only <u>one preloaded image</u>.
> Preloading multiple images worsens the LCP score. To verify that only one
> image is being preloaded, check that there is only one `<link rel="preload"/>`
> tag.
